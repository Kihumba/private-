# Guide to This Learning Path

At Andela, we are a community of passionate learners and innovators who live our values and use them to guide our actions. We want to empower leaders who will carry these values forward into the world, and influence others to believe in and practice them.

To do so, every one of us must know, understand, and embody our communal values. These EPIC OKBBs are a stepping stone into building a curriculum which guides people to grow into new life approaches, ways of being, and identities that help to unlock their potential, accelerate their transformation, and ultimately make all of us #limitless.

Just as our values are a community artifact, built by the collective brilliance and thoughtfulness of each and every Andelan, so are these OKBBs. We encourage every Andelan to add, make suggestions, and ask questions, as we create these learnings together.
