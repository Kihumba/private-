## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I would like to conduct a survey **Action:** I start by defining what I am trying to achieve, my target survey population, my timeline, and my research questions. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am designing a survey where the responses will be used by other stakeholders **Action:** I have a discussion with the stakeholders around what they intend to learn from the results and ensure their input is considered in the survey design.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When selecting the target survey respondents **Action:** I consider the overall population I aim to learn about and elicit survey responses that capture a representative sample of that population population. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When writing a survey question **Action:** I ask about one topic at a time and divide complex topics into multiple targeted questions. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When writing a survey question about perceived value or performance **Action:** I ask respondents to report on factors that can be easily judged to minimize noise from ambiguity and variance in interpretations between respondents. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When writing a survey question that may not be answerable by every survey respondent **Action:** I include an N/A option. | [ ] | [ ]  |

| **Context:** When writing a survey question that inquires about a respondent's level of satisfaction, agreement, or engagement with a topic **Action:** I use a likert scale. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:**When I would like to compare responses to the same question across multiple surveys **Action:** I try not to change the wording or order of the question or answers to avoid introducing a source of noise into the survey responses. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When writing a survey that takes longer than five minutes to complete: | | | |**Action:**I ensure that my questions are engaging. | [ ] | [ ]  |
|**Action:**I ensure that the questions are categorized in a logical manner. | [ ] | [ ]  |
|**Action:**I ensure that each follow up question is relevant to the answers given previously. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When designing a survey that will take more than five minutes to complete, that will have a large number of respondents and a substantial program impact **Action:** I beta test the survey with a handful of respondents and discuss their answers to gather feedback on the effectiveness of my survey design. | [ ] | [ ]  |

| **Context:** After gathering responses on a survey that will be delivered periodically **Action:** I analyze the responses to determine whether they are providing the desired information and use that analysis to improve the survey design, gathering feedback from respondents if necessary. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When a question on a periodic survey is not providing the desired information or is providing redundant information **Action:** I remove that question. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** Before sending out a survey **Action:** I consult with other stakeholders in my organization as necessary to avoid burdening the target survey population with multiple competing requests that may undermine response rates. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I ask people to take a survey **Action:** I clearly state the purpose of the survey, the estimated time for completion, and the deadline for response. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When response rates on the survey are low **Action:** I politely remind the respondents to complete the survey, emphasizing the low response rate and value of the survey, and leveraging personal relationships to encourage completion. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** After the deadline for survey completion has passed **Action:** I analyze results and discuss them with my team. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** After discussing the results with my team **Action:** I ensure that the results of the survey inform decisions related to the survey data. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** After analyzing the results **Action:** I share the findings with the survey respondents if possible. | [ ] | [ ]  |
