# Outcome 1 - Tracking Learner Progress

**Skill Description**
----------
Using the Andela Learning Map to track Fellow progress over time.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. A regularly updated record of each Fellow's progress in the section of the Learning Map for which you are responsible.


**KBBs**
----------
## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The difference between assessing and tracking. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The difference between self-reporting and colleague observations. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| How the individual sections of the Andela Learning Map work and what each is used for.     | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Types of progress events and how they get recorded       | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Appropriate timelines for progress      | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Types of progress interventions | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Types of outputs and methods for output verification | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When a Fellow has completed a progress event **Action:** I verify that their Learning Map is updated to reflect the progress event | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When observing a Fellow applying a knowledge unit at the appropriate time **Action:** I add a checkmark to the appropriate column in the Knowledge section of the corresponding Learning Outcome |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** When observing a Fellow behaving in accordance with an observable behavior **Action:** I add a checkmark to the appropriate column in the Behavior section of the corresponding Learning Outcome | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When sensing that a Fellow is acting from a place of and/or demonstrating a strongly held perspective that corresponds to a documented belief **Action:** I add a checkmark to the appropriate column of the Beliefs section of the Learning Outcome. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When analyzing a Fellow's progress over time **Action:** I add the checkmarks in each Learning Outcome and divide by the time since the first checkmark. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** Once at least one checkmark exists in each row of a Learning Outcome's KBBs **Action:** I verify whether the Fellow has completed the output(s) for that Learning Outcome. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When I notice that a Fellow's progress has stalled or is continuously slower than their peers **Action:** I recommend an intervention. | [ ] |    [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The only way to truly know how someone is progressing professionally is to track their behavior changes over time. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The application of knowledge is more meaningful tracked in real-time while it's being applied to a practical context. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| I am completely capable of sensing another person's beliefs and observing another person's behaviors. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Regular and frequent access to one's Learning Map progress provides the feedback that they need and accelerates their professional growth. | [ ] | [ ]  |
