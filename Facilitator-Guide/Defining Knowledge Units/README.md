#### _Defining Learning Outcomes 2 - Defining Knowledge Units_

**Skill Description**

Knowledge Units are the individual pieces of information someone must access in order to apply the skill described in the Learning Outcome. By defining the units themselves, Andelans can create opportunities for Fellows to guide their self-study and independent research while also encouraging curiosity and conversation about relevant topics. 

**Output**

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, an Andelan should be able to create the following:

1. Several researchable and discussable knowledge units relevant to a specific Learning Outcome.

**Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Topics of study relevant to the skill described in the Learning Outcome you're creating knowledge units for. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Examples of Knowledge Units used for similar/related skills. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The basic structure of a Knowledge Unit.     | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The difference between knowledge and memory.     | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The various levels of debatability created by different types of Knowledge Unit definitions.       | [ ] | [ ]  |


**Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before defining Knowledge Units for a Learning Outcome **Action:** I think through how I apply the skill I'm describing and record the information I have to recall in order to complete the Outputs previously defined. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have a list of what information I need to recall in order to complete the listed Outputs  **Action:** I organize the list into categories or nested lists. |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** After defining a list of knowledge categories needed to create the Outputs for a given Learning Outcome  **Action:** I summarize the knowledge categories as simply as I can using general phrases like "types of..." and "differences between...". | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When I'm finished defining the Knowledge Units I can recall |  |     |
| - **Action:** I perform the task described in the output to see if I missed anything. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| - **Action:** I add any relevant Knowledge Units that I didn't at first include. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| - **Action:** I verify the Knowledge Units invite curiosity, research, and discussion by sharing them with a sample of Fellows and observing their reactions. | [ ] |    [ ] |


**Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Knowledge Units that are concise to the point of terseness invite curiosity in the Learner. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| If I explain everything to a Fellow, I'm taking ownership of their learning away from them.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| If I tell a Fellow what they need to know, but not how they can  come to know it, they will author their own understanding.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| When it comes to learning something new, it's far better to craft your own words than recall someone else's.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
