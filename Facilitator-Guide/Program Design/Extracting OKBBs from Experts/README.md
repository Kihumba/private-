| **Context:** When I want to create an OKBB, **Action:** I identify 2 to 4 people in my network who have demonstrated expertise in the area of interest | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** Once I have identified a small group of experts, **Action:** I ask them to come together for a 20 to 30 minute conversation about the subject matter, for the purpose of drafting curriculum | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** Before the conversation with the experts, **Action:** I ensure that the call will be recorded if possible to provide supplementary learning resources | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Super-Context:** During the expert interview... |  |   |
| **Context:** At the start of the conversation with the experts, **Action:** I briefly remind everyone of the purpose of the call and ensure that everyone understands which topic we will be discussing | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** As soon as everyone is aligned on the purpose and topic for the conversation,  **Action:** I ask everyone to share their successes and challenges with the topic of interest to get the conversation flowing | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** While the experts are describing their successes and challenges with the skill, **Action:** I take notes on key themes | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** Once everyone has contributed and a handful of key themes have been raised,  **Action:** I ask for specific examples, details, and stories that reveal the beliefs, habits, and knowledge behind the key themes | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** Before the end of the meeting, **Action:** I ask everyone to agree to comment on the drafted curriculum once it is ready | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Super-Context:** Drafting the OKBB... |  |   |
| **Context:** Within a few days of the meeting, **Action:** I consolidate the notes in OKBB format, aiming for concise, relevant, and practical content | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** As soon as the the OKBB is drafted, **Action:** I share for comment with the experts with a specific timeline for review | [ ] | [ ]  |
