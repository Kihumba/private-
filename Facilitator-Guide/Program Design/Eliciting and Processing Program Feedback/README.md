# Program Design: Eliciting & Processing Program Feedback
Skill Description
With this skill, I will be able to elicit a wide range of feedback on a program, process that feedback into key learnings and action items, and report on feedback outcomes with stakeholders and feedback providers.

Outputs
----------
Output: Creating feedback strategy

- **Task:** Plan a strategy for eliciting program feedback
- **Resource:** Project management software (e.g. Google Apps)
- **Include:** Documentation of the goals of eliciting the feedback, target populations, feedback questions, feedback collection methods, and timelines with comments demonstrating input from your team


----------
Output: Processing Feedback

- **Task:** Harvest and consolidate program feedback, discuss the feedback with your team, and summarize key takeaways and action items
- **Resource:** Project management software (e.g. Google Apps)
- **Include:** Meeting notes from the discussion with your team around the feedback and documentation of key learnings and action items

----------
Output: Reporting on Feedback Outcomes

- **Task:** Report on key takeaways and action items that resulted from the feedback to stakeholders and feedback providers and enable subsequent discussion
- **Resource:** Collaboration or presentation software (e.g. Google Apps) and appropriate channels of communication (e.g. Slack, Hangouts, large-group presentation)
- **Include:** Documentation of any key discussion points or action items raised during discussion of feedback outcomes

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Super-Context:** Before eliciting program feedback... |  |   |
| **Context:** When I am planning on eliciting feedback, **Action:** I describe in writing what I want to learn from or be able to do with the feedback | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** Once I know my goals for the feedback I am seeking, **Action:** I work with my team to formulate a feedback strategy that defines target populations, feedback questions, feedback collection methods, and timelines | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to increase response rates from a large feedback population, **Action:** I segment the population into subgroups and personalize my communication to each subgroup | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Super-Context:** While eliciting program feedback... |  |   |
| **Context:** When I request that people provide feedback, **Action:** I explain why the feedback is important and what it will be used for | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want people to feel comfortable sharing all of their thoughts about a product, **Action:** I stress to them that they can’t do anything wrong in their interaction with the product; all of their thoughts are valid | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want ongoing feedback on a project from the same feedback providers, **Action:** I involve them as early as possible and make them feel comfortable sharing feedback openly and without hesitation | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When asking questions to elicit feedback, **Action:**I highlight how important the feedback provider’s perspective is and use conversational language that enables them to speak freely about their experience | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When soliciting real-time feedback on the user experience of a product, **Action:** I closely observe the user interacting with the product and take notes on how their intuition guides them to navigate the tool | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want more insight into a person’s mental experience of a program,  **Action:** I sit with them as they are interacting with the program and ask them to “speak aloud” their inner thoughts | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to capture impromptu feedback outside of structured feedback surveys or sessions, **Action:** I create a Slack channel or easily accessible form where feedback can be submitted | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Super-Context:** After eliciting program feedback... |  |   |
| **Context:** After eliciting feedback, **Action:** I process the feedback by consolidating it in writing and discussing it with my team | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** While processing the feedback, **Action:** I sort out the noise from the quality feedback and write down key learnings and action items from the quality feedback | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** Within one or two weeks of formulating key learnings and action items from the feedback, **Action:** I share these takeaways with program stakeholders and create an opportunity for input and discussion | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** After sharing key learnings and action items with program stakeholders, **Action:** I share with the audience that gave me feedback an update on any changes that resulted from their feedback | [ ] | [ ]  |




## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| There is no such thing as positive and negative feedback. The quality of feedback is determined by how well it enables growth. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Every perspective holds value. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Growth craves feedback. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Getting feedback earlier has more of an impact and saves time. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Other people will interact with my program in ways I could never imagine. | [ ] | [ ]  |
