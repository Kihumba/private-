# Program Design: Building Learning Tools
Skill Description
With this skill, I will be able to build tools that support the achievement of learning objectives. These learning tools will also enable program managers to analyze learner performance, and track learning program processes and outcomes.

Outputs
----------
Output: Building a learning tool

- **Task:** Design and implement a learning tool
- **Resource:** With input from users (learners and program managers)
- **Include:** Documentation of user input that informed the evolution of the tool

## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| How to simplify learning processes and performance outcomes into simple, consistent, generalizable indicators | [ ] | [ ]  |
| How to make learning/management tools “revealing experiences” that provide the right information at the right time | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Usability heuristics for user interface design | [ ] | [ ]  |
| How to identify the different users for your tool and the value the tool should provide to each type of user  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| How to differentiate between must-have and nice-to-have features for a tool | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Super-Context:** Before designing the tool... |  |   |
| **Context:** When I am considering building a learning tool to solve a problem, **Action:** I first discuss the scope of the problem with my team, what success looks like, and whether or not building a tool would be the right solution | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I set out to design a learning tool, **Action:** I first define who the users will be and what they should be able to achieve with the tool | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Super-Context:** While building the tool... |  |   |
| **Context:** Once the goals for my users are clear for the learning tool I am designing, **Action:** I build a minimum viable product and share it with collaborators and potential users as early as possible for feedback | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am building a tool that will help improve an existing process, **Action:** I start by discussing what is going well and what is causing the most difficulties with the current process with as many key stakeholders as possible | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When making decisions about the layout and features of a tool, **Action:** I envision the users interacting with the tool in their natural work/learning environment and make choices that will make the tool seamless and intuitive | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Super-Context:** Once the tool is live... |  |   |
| **Context:** Once users are interacting with the tool, **Action:** I observe how they are using it and elicit feedback to assess the extent to which the tool is meeting its goals | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I notice the tool is failing to meet a goal, **Action:** I discuss with my team how we can improve the tool in a deliberate way so as to improve the tool without causing confusion for its users | [ ] | [ ]  |




## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The most successful tools disappear into the natural workflow of the user. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Share early and often. You only know how people will use a tool when you see it in action. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Tools exist to help people improve their own lives. | [ ] | [ ]  |
