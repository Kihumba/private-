**Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| When it comes to helping people learn, showing is better than telling. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| My expertise shows up in what I pay attention to.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Helping my apprentice to pay attention to the same things I do is the best way to support them in learning what I've learned.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Apprenticeship sessions are collaborative. To get the most out of them, we must believe we are both learning together. | [ ] | [ ]  |
