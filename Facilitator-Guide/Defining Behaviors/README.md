#### _Defining Learning Outcomes 3 - Defining Behaviors_

**Skill Description**

Behaviors are the context/action pairs that describe what a Fellow does when filling a job role like Mid-Level Developer or Technical Team Lead. By defining the specific scenarios (contexts) and the specific behaviors (actions) to take in each scenario, Andelans can create opportunities for Fellows to demonstrate their attainment of the skills and abilities that allow them to perform in the roles they are aspiring to. Behaviors also serve as the most explicit documentation of the expertise and specific job tasks required in each role. 

**Output**

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, an Andelan should be able to create the following:

1. A relatively complete list of the behaviors required to demonstrate attainment of the correspoding skill. All behaviors in this list should have specific, actionable contexts and directly observable actions. 

**Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The types of behaviors required to demonstrate the corresponding skill. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The specific scenarios someone regularly faces when performing the corresponding job role. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| How specific contexts need to be to trigger actions.     | [ ] | [ ]  |
| How specific actions need to be to provide clear direction.     | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The basic mechanics of behavior change.    | [ ] | [ ]  |
| A list of people who already exhibit the desired behaviors.    | [ ] | [ ]  |


**Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before defining behaviors for a Learning Outcome **Action:** I make a list of the most important scenarios where the desired behaviors should occur. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have a list of the most important scenarios  **Action:** I define individual contexts in time, place, and/or situation.  |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have a set of well defined contexts  **Action:** I add 1-5 actions to each context. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** Given a draft of context/action pairs |  |     |
| - **Action:** I perform the task described in the output to see if I missed anything. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| - **Action:** I attempt to reduce the number of actions I have assigned to each context, creating additional more specific contexts as needed. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| - **Action:** I verify the behaviors with practitioners of the skill and ask them for any additional scenarios they believe need to be addressed. | [ ] |    [ ] |


**Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The more specific I make the context, the easier it will be for Fellows to adopt the new behavior. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Our behaviors commmunicate our skills to our colleagues more than any words could.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Desireable behaviors show up in both tech and soft skills.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Behavior change is like a muscle, the more I exercise it, the stronger and faster I become.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Well documented behaviors invite Fellows to program themselves for success.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
