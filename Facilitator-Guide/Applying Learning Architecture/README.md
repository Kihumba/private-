#### _Learning & Development - Applying Learning Architecture Principles_

**Skill Description**

Learning Architecture is the intentional designing, building, and deploying of learning tools and environments. It's any Learning & Development trainer's most potent resource in crafting great learning opportunities and accelerating the distribution of skills and knowledge across a community or organization. By applying the framework of Learning Architecture to your existing training, teaching, or coaching practice, you'll be able to deliberately improve your learner's results and measure the impact of the changes you make.

**Output**

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. A detailed plan to improve one part of an existing training program and track the value of any changes made.

**Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When Defining what Andela Fellows need to learn  |  |  |
| - **Action:** I identify the skills required of the job role the Fellow is seeking. |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| - **Action:** I create Learning Outcomes (Skill Descriptions, Outputs, and KBBs) based on each of the identified skills. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| - **Action:** I decide which skills Fellows must possess before they are ready to start work on the Learning Outcomes I created. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| - **Action:** I consider the possible sequencing and any dependencies for the Learning Outcomes I've created. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When facilitating Fellow's in achieving their Learning Outcomes |  |     |
| - **Action:** I decide on a strategy for creating and maintaining flow through the cognitive Learning Loop.  | [ ] |    [ ] |
| - **Action:** I identify and provide the needed environment, tools, and resources to achieve the Learning Outcome. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| - **Action:** I identify opportunities for Fellows to leverage each other and learn from their online/offline community/social interactions. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When tracking Fellow progress  |  |    |
| - **Action:** I provide opportunites for Fellows to self-report their progress. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| - **Action:** I arrange for feedback events where Fellow progress can be validated by peers, clients, staff members, or other professionals.  | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to determine the business value of Fellow progress  **Action:** I measure it against Andela's KPIs for the Fellowship.  | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When I'm applying Learning Architecture principles to my work  **Action:** I look for the highest priority opportunities to do so, ones that will have the largest, most immediate impact on Fellow success.  | [ ] |    [ ] |


**Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Learning Architecture is a combination of art and science. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| When helping people learn it's very important to be deliberate, well-informed, and considerate.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| I must repeatedly ask myself, who are my learners and how do they look at the world?  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| I'm insatiably curious about how people learn best. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Learning styles don't exist, but most people think they do, so I have to find ways to leverage that perspective in my learning designs. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| I always want to know what motivations drive the behaviors I'm seeing. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| As a Learning Architect, I'm responsible for helping people shape themselves into whomever they want to be. | [ ] | [ ]  |
