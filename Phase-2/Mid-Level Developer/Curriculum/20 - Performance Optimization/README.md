# Outcome 20 - Performance Optimization

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands the importance of application performance, how it impacts the overall goals of the company and consequences on users. In addition, the fellow can use tools to baseline performance, use their knowledge of systems design and algorithms to improve, and clearly convey the results 

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. Performance monitoring configuration for an existing system
2. System improvements based on monitoring report


**Objectives**

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When deploying an application **Action:** I set up a performance monitoring system with it | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I get negative performance reports **Action:** I investigate the reports to identify the cause of poor performance | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** After identifying causes of poor performance **Action:** I leverage my understanding of systems design and algorithms/data structures to make improvement recommendations (solutions and expected results)  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** After performance improvement recommendations have been implemented **Action:** I compare the performance metrics to the expected metrics in the recommendations   | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| If I don't monitor the performance of my applications, I cannot meaningfully improve them | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Application performance is what sets great developers apart from merely competent developers | [ ] | [ ]  |
