# Outcome 15 - Security

**Skill Description**
----------
Fellows demonstrate a general understanding of how to analyze code, identify and close vulnerabilities.

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. Security analysis of a vulnerable program with identified vulnerabilities
2. Version of above program with vulnerabilities closed


**Objectives**
----------
## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |
| * Security vulnerability | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Types of attacks/exploits     | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Common vulnerabilities with web and mobile application     | [ ] | [ ]  |


----------


## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I build applications **Action:** I test my code with the mindset of an attacker seeking vulnerabilities | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I test my code **Action:** I run security tests for common vulnerabilities | [ ] | [ ]  |



----------


## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that I can build more secure applications by thinking like an attacker when building and testing | [ ] | [ ]  |
