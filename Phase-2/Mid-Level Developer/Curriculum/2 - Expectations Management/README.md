# Outcome 2 - Expectations Management

**Skill Description**
----------

The Fellow proactively alerts stakeholders to slips in schedules as soon as they become aware of them along with a revised timeframe for delivery and a clear explanation of the cause for the slip.  The Fellow presents to Client / other stakeholders alternatives for requests that cannot realistically be met, along with clear pros and cons of each option and a recommendation for which option to pursue.



**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. Discussion with a Staff Member describing my habits of managing expectations, supported by real examples from my work with my Client and at Andela.
2. Recorded role play simulating a response to a slip in schedule or receiving unrealistic expectations that cannot be met, including an email summary of proposed alternatives to the original expectations.
