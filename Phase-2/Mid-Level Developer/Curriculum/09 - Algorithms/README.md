# Outcome 9 - Algorithms

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands the most common search, data analysis and optimization algorithms and has the ability to identify the correct algorithm for a given situation based on accuracy and efficiency.

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. HackerRank exercises on search, data analysis and optimization as specified by Success Department 


**Objectives**
----------
## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |
| * In-order, Pre-order, Post-order tree traversal | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Breadth-first search     | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Depth-first search     | [ ] | [ ]  |


----------


## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before I start to write a solution program to a problem **Action:** I look for existiing algorithms that are similar to the problem I'm trying to solve | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I select an exisiting algorithm to leverage **Action:** I choose the best-fit based on accuracy and efficiency for my use case | [ ] | [ ]  |



----------


## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Familiarity of common algorithms will help me come up with solutions faster because I'd be able to identify common solution patterns for similar problems | [ ] | [ ]  |
