## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:
| **Context:** When I have to create a function that accepts multiple parameters **Action:** I curry it. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have to manipulate data in an array **Action:** I utilize map-reduce over traditional loops | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have to apply transformations on structured data  **Action:** I decompose the transformations into small, easily understood and composable morphisms to pipe the data through. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have to refactor code with a bunch of impure functions  **Action:** I extract the impure functionality and wrap it in pure wrappers.  | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Utilizing the functional programming principles make my code more modular, reusable, testable and predictable | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Favouring declarative over imperative coding makes my code easier to reason about. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Understanding functional programming makes me a craftsman even when developing in languages that do not necessary support functional programming conventionally  | [ ] | [ ]  |
