## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** In any engagement **Action:** I frequently seek feedback from all stakeholders to identify areas for improvement |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** After I receive feedback **Action:** I write down the specific areas for improvement and share it with the person who delivered the feedback for confirmation |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** After confirming areas for improvement **Action:** I decided whether to use SMART vs Stretch goals (or a combination) as a structured approach to address those areas for improvement |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** After deciding on a structured approach to address feedback **Action:** I put the structured approach to acting on the feedback in writing and share it with relevant stakeholders |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** After sufficient time has passed to make progress on my structured response to feedback **Action:** I record notes / data on my progress and share with relevant stakeholders |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Feedback is critical to self-awareness. Structure is critical to self-improvement. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Systematic response to feedback breeds trust and respect | [ ] | [ ] |
| If I truly value feedback I must commit to acting on it | [ ] | [ ] | 
| When I add structure to my goals, I become a much more powerful learner | [ ] | [ ] |
