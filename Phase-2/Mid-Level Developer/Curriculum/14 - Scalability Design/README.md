# Outcome 14 - Scalability Design

**Skill Description**
----------
The fellow understands the importance of scaling, how it impacts the overall goals of the company and consequences on users. They know when to make trade-offs between scalability designing for short term and long-terms goals. They're relentless in thinking about their design decisions and how it'll work in the future at 10x usage.

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. A project with tests simulations how the systems performs with 1000, 100000, 1000000, 100000000 users
2. Documentation explaining the scalability design learnings and decisions that were made
