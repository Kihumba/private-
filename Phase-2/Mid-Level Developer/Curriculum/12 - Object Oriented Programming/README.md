# Outcome 12 - Object Oriented Programming

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands the SOLID (Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation and Dependency inversion) principles of object oriented programming and knows how to refactor code to align with SOLID.

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. Object-oriented programs that adhere to the SOLID principle
