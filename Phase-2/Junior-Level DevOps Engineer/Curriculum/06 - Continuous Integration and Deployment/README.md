# Outcome 06 - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment

Skill Description
------------------
The fellow understands the practice of integrating new code into the main branch and can put together a pipeline that will automate the testing of the new code after integration.

The fellow also understands how the process of deploying code to the production environment after it successfully passes through the automated testing pipeline.


Outputs
-------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a fellow should be able to do the following:

- Create a source control repository to manage versions of a release
- Create a pipeline that will run tests whenever a commit is checked in, and will tag successful builds
- Do a blue-green deploy of a successful test build to a production environment

## **Beliefs**

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt          | Demonstrated |
|:------------------|:------------------:|:------------:|
| Successful builds should be versioned | [ ] | [ ] |
| Code is tested before committed to a repository | [ ] | [ ] |
| Code should only be deployed to production when it passes tests | [ ] | [ ] |
| Adapt fast and deploy releases frequently | [ ] | [ ] |
| CI system helps to automate build testing | [ ] | [ ] |
| Software release should be tested on an environment similar to a production environment | [ ] | [ ] |
