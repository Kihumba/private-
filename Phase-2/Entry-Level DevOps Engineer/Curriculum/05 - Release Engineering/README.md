# Outcome 05 - Release Engineering

Skill Description
-----------------
The fellow should understand why release engineering is necessary, how to do proper branch management and how to document release procedures

They should also know how to use build tools to automate release processes that transform source code into a product that is ready for release. Fellows must also know how to manage the different versions of released products and push updated minor releases with bug fixes


Outputs
-------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a Fellow should be able to create the following:

1. A completed exercise that covers the following operations:
  - Setting up a release plan for builds that have been tested through a CI system
  - Versioning the builds as final builds and placing them on a storage server
  - Creating release notes that identify the changes and fixes to the software that are present in the release
  - Documenting release procedures on how to deploy/deliver the release
2. Release procedure documentation for a system

## **Knowledge**

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-----------------|:-----------------:|:-------:|
| I can describe the following from memory:| | |
| How to implement code builds and automated deployment procedures | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to document release procedures for replication | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to setup a deployment process for deploying releases  | [ ] | [ ] |

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:----------------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When creating a release **Action:** I use only builds that have been thoroughly tested | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When creating a release **Action:** I ensure all code dependencies are met and present in the build | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After a release is created **Action:** I add release notes to identify the changes/fixes that are present in the release | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After a release is created **Action:** I apply a release tag and add it to version control | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After a release is created **Action:** I add the release to the storage system for tracking builds | [ ] | [ ] |

## **Beliefs**

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt          | Demonstrated |
|:------------------|:------------------:|:------------:|
| Software releases should be immutable | [ ] | [ ] |
| Builds should be rigorously tested before being made into a release | [ ] | [ ] |
