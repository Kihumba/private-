# Outcome 05 - Release Engineering

Skill Description
-----------------
The Fellow will be able to do proper branch management and document release procedures. Additionally, they will be able to use build tools to automate release processes that transform source code into a product that is ready for release. 


Outputs
-------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

1. A completed exercise that covers the following operations:
  - Setting up a release plan for builds that have been tested through a CI system
  - Versioning the builds as final builds and placing them on a storage server
  - Creating release notes that identify the changes and fixes to the software that are present in the release
  - Documenting release procedures on how to deploy/deliver the release

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:----------------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When creating a release **Action:** I use only builds that have been thoroughly tested | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When creating a release **Action:** I ensure all code dependencies are met and present in the build | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After a release is created **Action:** I add release notes to identify the changes/fixes that are present in the release | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After a release is created **Action:** I apply a release tag and add it to version control | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After a release is created **Action:** I add the release to the storage system for tracking builds | [ ] | [ ] |

## **Beliefs**

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt          | Demonstrated |
|:------------------|:------------------:|:------------:|
| Software releases should be immutable | [ ] | [ ] |
| Builds should be rigorously tested before being made into a release | [ ] | [ ] |
