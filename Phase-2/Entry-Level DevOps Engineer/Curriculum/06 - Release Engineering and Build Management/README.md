# Outcome 06 - Release Engineering & Build Management

Skill Description
-----------------
A person with this skill can explain why release engineering is necessary. They can use build tools to automate release processes that transform source code into a product that is ready for release, while executing proper branch management and documenting release procedures. 


Outputs
-------
- **Task:** Create a release plan for builds that have been tested through a CI system, and document release procedures on how to deploy/deliver the release.
- **Resources:** Choose a release engineering tool of your choice-- be able to defend why you chose that specific tool.
- **Include:** Use a project you or a team member are working on as an example.

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:----------------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When creating a release **Action:** I use only builds that have been thoroughly tested | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When creating a release **Action:** I ensure all code dependencies are met and present in the build | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After a release is created **Action:** I add release notes to identify the changes/fixes that are present in the release | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After a release is created **Action:** I apply a release tag and add it to version control | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After a release is created **Action:** I add the release to the storage system for tracking builds | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to automatically generate builds for every commit to a repository **Action:** I set up a pipeline using a configuration tool | [ ] | [ ] |

## **Beliefs**

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt          | Demonstrated |

| Software releases should be immutable | [ ] | [ ] |
