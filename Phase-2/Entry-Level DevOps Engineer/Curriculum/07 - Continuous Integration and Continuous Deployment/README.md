# Outcome 07 - Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment

Skill Description
-----------------
A person with this skill can set up an environment for continuous integration and merge development work with a Master/Trunk/Mainline branch. They should know how to write automated tests and unit tests, and when to test code to catch issues early and maintain a stable production branch. Finally, they should know how to deploy code to the production environment as soon as it has passed testing and is ready. 


Outputs
-------
- **Task:** Create and configure a CI pipeline to automate integration with a Mainline branch when a new commit is checked in. Make sure that you run tests on the code prior to merging. 
- **Resources:** Use a CI tool of your choice-- be able to defend your choice of tools
- **Include:** Work with a project you or a teammate are building
