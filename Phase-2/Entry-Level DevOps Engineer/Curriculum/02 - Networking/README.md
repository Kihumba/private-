# Outcome 02 - Networking

Skill Description
-----------------
The Fellow should be able to list network interfaces and routing table. They should be able to configure a device on the network and open any necessary or needed ports. They should also be able to list all currently open ports on the system. The Fellow should know the basics of using a firewall to control access to the system.



Outputs
-------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a fellow should be able to complete the following:

1. An exercise that covers the following operations:
  - Displaying network interfaces
  - Displaying network routing table
  - Using a subnet mask to allocate IP addresses on a network
  - Setting up port forwarding from one host to another
  - Viewing all open and connected ports on a system
  - Using a network firewall to control access to a system
