# Outcome 02 - Networking

Skill Description
-----------------
The Fellow will be able to work with network interfaces, routing tables, and ports to configure a device on a network. The Fellow will also be able to work with a Firewall to control access to the system.


Outputs
-------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to complete the following:

1. An exercise that covers the following operations:
  - Displaying network interfaces
  - Displaying network routing table
  - Using a subnet mask to allocate IP addresses on a network
  - Setting up port forwarding from one host to another
  - Viewing all open and connected ports on a system
  - Using a network firewall to control access to a system
