# Outcome 11 - Backup & Restore

Skill Description
-----------------
A person with this skill can back up data on a system so as to be able to recover from data loss or system crashes.



Outputs
-------
- **Task:** On either an existing or new application, set up recurring automatic backups of critical data (database, e.t.c) on the system. Also set up scripts to verify the backups to ensure it is valid and restorable and to move the backup data to an external store (AWS S3). 
- **Resources:** Be able to defend your choice of tools based on your product’s system
- **Include:** N/A

| **Context:** When I develop a plan to backup data **Action:** I identify the critical data that should be backed up | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I develop a plan to backup data **Action:** I set a recurring schedule at which the data should be backed up | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am backing up a system **Action:** I encrypt and store it in a secure manner | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After I backup data on a system **Action:** I encrypt it so as not to expose user data | [ ] | [ ] |

| **Context:** After I move the backup to an external system for safekeeping **Action:** I delete the backup from the system to free up space | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I restore data on a system **Action:** I fetch the data from the remote store and place it on the machine | [ ] | [ ] |
