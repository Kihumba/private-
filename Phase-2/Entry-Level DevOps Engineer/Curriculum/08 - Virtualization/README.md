# Objective 08 - Virtualization

Skill Description
-----------------
A person with this can explain the definition of Virtualization, how it is applied in DevOps. They can use Virtualization to concurrently run multiple operating system instances on a single computer. 

Output
-----------------
- **Task:** Set up and configure a virtual machine of your choice to run a Windows software on your machine (or visa versa if you are currently using Windows) 
- **Resources:** Use one of the most common virtualization tools and be able to explain why you chose that one
- **Include:** N/A
