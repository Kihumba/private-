# Outcome 06 - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment

Skill Description
-----------------
The fellow understands the practice of integrating new code into the main branch and can put together a pipeline that will automate the testing of the new code after integration.

The fellow also understands how the process of deploying code to the production environment after it successfully passes through the automated testing pipeline.


Outputs
-------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a fellow should be able to do the following:

- Create a source control repository to manage versions of a release
- Create a CI pipeline for the engineering team to run tests when a commit is checked in, tag successful builds, and deploy the build
- Describe the blue-green deployment strategy

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:----------------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before committing code to a repository **Action:** I run tests locally | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When a build fails tests on CI **Action:** I fix it in a timely manner and then redeploy | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When a build fails tests on CI **Action:** I fix it in a timely manner and then redeploy | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After a build is successful **Action:** I tag it with a version | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When deploying a build to production **Action:** I deploy the version of the build that passes all tests | [ ] | [ ] |

## **Beliefs**

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt          | Demonstrated |
|:------------------|:------------------:|:------------:|
| Code should only be deployed to production when it passes tests | [ ] | [ ] |
| Adapt fast and deploy releases frequently | [ ] | [ ] |
| Software release should be tested on an environment similar to a production environment | [ ] | [ ] |
| CD systems enables releasing deployable software at any time | [ ] | [ ] |
| CI systems provides feedback about failure and enables developers to have more confidence in making their changes | [ ] | [ ] |
| Automating repetitive processes saves time and effort | [ ] | [ ] |
