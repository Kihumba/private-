# Outcome 08 - Platform As A Service

Skill Description
-----------------
The Fellow is able to utilize the features provided by a PaaS to effectively address server management, database management, operations expertise etc. so that they can invest more time on application development.


Outputs
-------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a fellow should be able to complete the following:

1. An exercise that covers the following operations:
  - Creating and pushing an app to a PaaS
  - Binding an external service such as a database to the app
  - Scaling the app to multiple instances

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:----------------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before I deploy my app to a PaaS **Action:** I look for a PaaS that has the app runtime support required to run my app code | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I deploy my app to a PaaS **Action:** I look for a PaaS that has the database that my app needs  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I deploy my app to a PaaS **Action:** I check if there are any PaaS-specific config files needed to run my app properly | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I deploy my app to a PaaS **Action:** I put together a list of dependencies needed to run my app | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After I deploy my app to a PaaS **Action:** I check that it is running and accessible | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When my app instances cannot handle the amount of incoming requests **Action:** I use the PaaS to scale the instances | [ ] | [ ] |

## **Beliefs**

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:------------------|:--------------:|:------------:|
| PaaS eases the pain of deployment and takes care of the overhead of deploying applications | [ ] | [ ] |
| PaaS allows you to focus only on application development as the rest is taken care of | [ ] | [ ] |
| PaaS makes release management easy (rolling back code and deploying code) | [ ] | [ ] |
