# Outcome 03 - Configuration/Change Management & Tools

Skill Description
-----------------
The Fellow will be comfortable implementing the standard processes, techniques, and tools to manage changes in a development environment. Additionally, the Fellow will be able to setup and configure common software (MySQL, Apache Web Server, MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS, PHP, Python, etc) on a VM using the Ansible configuration tool. 


Outputs
-------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to complete the following:

1. An exercise that covers the following operations:
  - Setting up a test harness to test and verify configuration scripts
  - Setting up a development stack (e.g. the MEAN stack) on a VM using the `ansible` configuration tool
  - Setting up the ELK stack (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana, with nginx reverse proxy) on a VM using the `ansible` configuration tool
