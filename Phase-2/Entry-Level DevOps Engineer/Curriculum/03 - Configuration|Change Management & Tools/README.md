# Outcome 03 - Configuration/Change Management & Tools

Skill Description
-----------------
The Fellow should understand the standard processes, techniques and tools used to manage the changes in an environment and be able to use them. They should understand and articulate what configuration & change management is and the problems it solves

The fellow should be able to setup and configure common software (MySQL, Apache Web Server, MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS, PHP, Python, etc) on a VM using the Ansible configuration tool


Outputs
-------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a fellow should be able to complete the following:

1. An exercise that covers the following operations:
  - Setting up a test harness to test and verify configuration scripts
  - Setting up a development stack (e.g. the MEAN stack) on a VM using the `ansible` configuration tool
  - Setting up the ELK stack (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana, with nginx reverse proxy) on a VM using the `ansible` configuration tool
