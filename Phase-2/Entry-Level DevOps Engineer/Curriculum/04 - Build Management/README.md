# Outcome 04 - Build Management

Skill Description
------------------
The fellow understands the process of managing and automating the build and delivery of software builds


Outputs
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a fellow should be able to do the following:

- Setup a pipeline using a configuration tool to automate the build process and automatically generate builds for every commit to a repository
- Identify tools used for build management
- Apply versioning scheme using semver (major, minor, patch, build)
