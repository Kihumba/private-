# Outcome 04 - Build Management

Skill Description
------------------
The Fellow will be comfortable with the process of managing and automating a build system. 


Outputs
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to complete the following:

1. An exercise that covers the following operations:
  - Setting up a pipeline using a configuration tool to automate the build process and automatically generate builds for every commit to a repository
  - Identifying tools used for build management
  - Applying a versioning scheme using semver (major, minor, patch, build)

|:------------------|:------------------:|:------------:|
| A software build is immutable | [ ] | [ ] |
| Changes to the software code result in a new build | [ ] | [ ] |
| A software build should be reproducible | [ ] | [ ] |
