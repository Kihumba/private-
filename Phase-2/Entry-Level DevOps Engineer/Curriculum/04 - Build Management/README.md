# Outcome 04 - Build Management

Skill Description
------------------
The Fellow understands the process of managing and automating the build and delivery of software builds


Outputs
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a Fellow should be able to complete the following:

1. An exercise that covers the following operations:
  - Setting up a pipeline using a configuration tool to automate the build process and automatically generate builds for every commit to a repository
  - Identifying tools used for build management
  - Applying a versioning scheme using semver (major, minor, patch, build)


**Objectives**

## **Beliefs**

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt          | Demonstrated |
|:------------------|:------------------:|:------------:|
| A software build is immutable | [ ] | [ ] |
