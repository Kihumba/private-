# Proxy (Reverse Proxy)

**Skill Description**
----------
This skill involves knowing and understanding the function of a **reverse proxy** also commonly known as **proxy** in the microservices architecture; to control access to web services.

It also involves how to use and configure a proxy to do the following: load balancing, caching and authentication.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to do the following:

- Implement SSL termination using a proxy.
- Implement caching to cache static content that doesn't need to be served by the web service.
- Implement authentication before the request is routed to the web service.
- Use a proxy to load balance requests across multiple instances of a web service.
- Use a proxy to compress traffic to speed up load time.

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:----------------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When setting up a proxy server, **Action:** I ensure that static content is served by the proxy. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When setting up a proxy server, **Action:** I ensure that dynamic content is routed to the web service and not cached. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When setting up a proxy server, **Action:** I ensure that the original request is routed to the web service. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When setting up a proxy server, **Action:** I ensure that all headers in the original request is preserved and passed to the web service. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When setting up a proxy server, **Action:** I ensure caching is enabled for requests that can be cached. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When setting up a proxy server, **Action:** I ensure load balancing is implemented for requests to web services. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When setting up a proxy server, **Action:** I ensure compression is implemented to speed up response load time and proper compression headers are added to the response. | [ ] | [ ]  |
