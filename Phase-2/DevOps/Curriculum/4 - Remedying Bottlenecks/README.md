# Remedying Bottlenecks

**Skill Description**
----------
This skills involves the process of fixing an identified performance bottleneck in a particular environment.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to do the following:

* You will be provided with an _AWS deployment_ that has various bottlenecks. You will be required to identify the bottlenecks from the analysis given, then do a write-up on how you will go about fixing them, then go ahead and practically implement your remedy.


**Objectives**
----------
## **Knowledge**

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe, from memory, the common issues that cause performance bottlenecks in the following parts of the application, and how to go about fixing them: | | |
| * Load Balancing Tier         | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Web/Application Server Tier | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Caching Tier                | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Database Tier               | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I have fixed a particular bottleneck on a deployment, **Action:** I first do a simulated test in the _staging environment_ before implementing the changes in the _production environment_. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When setting up monitoring for any service, **Action:** I make sure I have set alerts and notifications for critical metrics that may cause performance bottlenecks e.g. maxing out on CPU and memory usage. | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Monitoring is vital for identifying system bottlenecks and fixing them. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The best way of handling performance bottlenecks is by anticipating them using the already provided monitoring, other than reacting to them when the failure has already occured. | [ ] | [ ]  |
