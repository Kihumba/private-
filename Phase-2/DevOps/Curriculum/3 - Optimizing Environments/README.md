# Optimizing Environments

**Skill Description**
----------
This skill involves analyzing and optimizing deployment environments to ensure maximum performance.

However, it should be noted that this is optimizing specifically for _maximum performance_ and **not** _cost-optimization_, as much as there is a correlation.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to do the following:

- Write a blog-post on the common optimization techniques for AWS environment; and recommend best practices on how to go about optimizing AWS environments for maximum performance.
- Analyze monitoring metrics from a production AWS environment and give recommendations on what should be done to optimize the performance. If the performance is already maximum, give reasons what caused the good performance.


**Objectives**
----------
## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe, from memory, the various parts of the _environment_ and optimization techniques that can be applied: | | |
| * Load Balancing Tier         | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Web/Application Server Tier | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Caching Tier                | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Database Tier               | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to optimize any part of the environment, **Action:** I first analyze the collected data from the monitoring tools. | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Even well-architected deployment need regular optimization because over time deployments grow organically in ways that you never plan. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Performance optimization go hand-in-hand with cost optimization. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Monitoring is key for optimization, since you cannot optimize without available data to inform. | [ ] | [ ]  |
