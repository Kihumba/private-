# Backup & Restore

**Skill Description**
----------
Involves knowing how to create periodic backups of the data on a system to allow for restoring to a previous state in the event of data loss or accidental deletion.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to do the following:

- Identify the critical data in a system that should be backed up.
- Identify the backup schedule. How frequently the data can be backed up to mitigate data loss.
- Identify how long the backups should be kept before being deleted.
- Identify how much disk space is needed for the data dumps.
- Identify the critical components of an application that should be backed up.
- Put together automation scripts to simplify the backup & restore process.
- Document the procedure of steps to be followed when a failure occurs.
- Move the backups to a remote location in case of machine failure.
- How to restore a data backup.

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-----------------|:-----------------:|:---------:|
| I can describe, from memory, why data backups are important. [ ] | [ ]  |
| I can describe, from memory, the vital data in a system that should be backed up. [ ] | [ ]  |
| I can describe, from memory, the process of restoring data to get a system back to a desired state. [ ] | [ ]  |


## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:----------------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When backing up system data, **Action:** I ensure that I define a schedule for automated backups. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When backing up system data, **Action:** I ensure the backup data is moved to a remote location in case of machine failure. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When backing up system data, **Action:** I ensure the backup data is deleted from local machine after the move to free up space. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When restoring system data, **Action:** I ensure that services reading & writing data are suspended so as to prevent data corruption. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When restoring system data, **Action:** I ensure the backup data is downloaded to the machine before a restore. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When restoring system data, **Action:** I ensure the backup data is deleted from local machine after restore to free up space. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When restoring system data, **Action:** I ensure that services reading & writing data are resumed after restore is completed. | [ ] | [ ]  |


## **Beliefs**
