# Outcome 4 - Data Structures

**Skill Description**
----------
By the end of Phase A - Homestudy, aspiring Andelans should be able to understand how to organize and store data for efficient search and retrieval. This means they are able to make use of the appropriate data structure for data storage.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to:

1. Complete and pass Proctor assessment that tests knowledge of data structures.


**Objectives**
