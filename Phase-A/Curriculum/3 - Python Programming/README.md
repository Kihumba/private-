# Outcome 3 - Python Programming

**Skill Description**
----------
Aspiring Andelans know the syntax, semantics, pragmatics and applications of the Python programming language. They know the model of programming associated with Python and type of programming language it is. They can set up a Python programming environment.They know how to represent and use data types, variables, control structures, modules and functions in Python. They can also leverage on the basics of Python to realize their vision of how they want to use code.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create:

1. A screenshot of a score of 80% or higher in the introduction to programming module on Proctor.
