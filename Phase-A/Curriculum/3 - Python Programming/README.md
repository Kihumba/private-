# Outcome 3 - Python Programming

**Skill Description**
----------
Aspiring Andelans understand how to represent and use data types, variables and control structures in Python. They know what modules and functions are and how to write them in Python. They can also leverage on the basics of Python to realize their vision of how they want to use code.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will have:

1. A score of 80% or higher in the introduction to programming module on Proctor.
