# Outcome 3 - Object Oriented Programming

**Skill Description**
----------
By the end of Phase A - Homestudy, aspiring Andelans should be able to understand general OOP concepts and OOP in Python. This means that they can model a problem based off of the Object oriented programming paradigm.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to:

1. Complete and pass Proctor assessment that tests knowledge of object oriented programming.


**Objectives**

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When creating model classes, **Action:** I properly represent the objects and behaviors of the class. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When modelling an object **Action:** I define my attributes as variables and behaviour as methods within my class. |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** When doing OOP data modelling **Action:** I strive to ensure my code is DRY by building reusable components. |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** When doing OOP data modelling **Action:** I take advantage of Inheritance to ensure I am reusing code as much as possible. |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |



----------


## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I have a clear picture of a programming problem when I model using OOP.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| My application's codebase is more sustainable and resuable when I use OOP. | [ ] | [ ]  |
