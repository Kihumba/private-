# Outcome 2 - Introduction to Programming

**Skill Description**
----------
By the end of Phase A - Homestudy, aspiring Andelans should be able to understand the act of writing a sequence of instructions to a computer to perform a specific task. This means they can identify a programming language and write computer programs.
They should also be able to understand the underlying concepts behind computer programming.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to:

1. Complete and pass Proctor assessment that tests knowledge of programming.
