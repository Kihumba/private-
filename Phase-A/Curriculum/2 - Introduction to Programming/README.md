# Outcome 2 - Introduction to Programming

**Skill Description**
----------
Aspiring Andelans should be able to use data types, variables, control structures, functions and modules in Python. They should be able to identify which environment or tools are needed for setup before programming. They also should be able to describe basic concepts behind programming.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will have:

1. A score of 80% or higher on Proctor.
