# Outcome 2 - Programming Fundamentals

**Skill Description**
----------
Aspiring Andelans know what a computer program is and understand the basics. They understand and can explain to their peers what programming is and the general programming concepts. They know the different models of programming, types of programming languages and can give examples of each model and type. They also have the capacity to identify and build the environment that enables them to code.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create:

1. A screenshot of a score of 80% or higher in the introduction to programming module on Proctor.
