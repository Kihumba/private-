# Outcome 5 - Algorithms

**Skill Description**
----------
By the end of Phase A - Homestudy, aspiring Andelans should be able to understand what algorithms are and how to implement algorithms in Python. They are also exposed to different problem solving techniques are able to figure out the Big O of the algorithm.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to:

1. Complete and pass Proctor assessment that tests knowledge on algorithms.
