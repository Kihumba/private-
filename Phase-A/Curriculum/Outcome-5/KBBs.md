# Algorithms - KBBs

## Knowledge
1. Definition of an Algorithm
2. The importance of algorithms.
3. What is algorithm analysis?
4. The Big O notation and how it is calculated
5. How to implement algorithms in Python



  
## Behaviors
1. When given a problem set, I figure out the most efficient algorithm to use.
2. When given a problem, I am able to implement an efficient algorithm in Python.
3. When building an algorithm, I consider efficiency and calculate the Big O of the algorithm.




## Beliefs
1. I believe that the efficiency of a program is determined by the algorithm been used.
2. I believe that understanding how to analyse algorithms (i.e. using the Big O notation) helps in writing more efficient algorithms.
