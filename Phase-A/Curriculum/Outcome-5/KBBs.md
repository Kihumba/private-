# Algorithms - KBBs
**Summary:** The following are the Knowledge, Behaviors, and Beliefs associated with the algorithms module. They should have been engaged with by the end of Homestudy.

## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Definition of an Algorithm. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The importance of algorithms. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| What is algorithm analysis? | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The Big O notation and how it is calculated    | [ ] | [ ]  |
| How to implement algorithms in Python      | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When given a problem **Action:** I figure out the most efficient algorithm to use. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When given a problem **Action:** I am able to implement an efficient algorithm in Python. |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** When building an algorithm **Action:** I consider efficiency and calculate the Big O of the algorithm. |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that the efficiency of a program is determined by the algorithm been used. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| I believe that understanding how to analyse algorithms (i.e. using the Big O notation) helps in writing more efficient algorithms. | [ ] | [ ]  |
