# Outcome 4 - Object Oriented Programming

**Skill Description**
----------
Aspiring Andelans understand what object oriented programming is and how to apply this paradigm when modeling problems. They can explain to their peers general OOP concepts and how OOP is implemented in Python. They also understand how to create classes with properties and methods and take advantage of OOP to keep their code DRY.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will have:

1. A score of 80% or higher in the object oriented programming module on Proctor.
