# Outcome 4 - Object Oriented Programming

**Skill Description**
----------
Aspiring Andelans should be able to discuss general OOP concepts and how OOP is implemented in Python with their peers. This means that they understand how to model a problem based on the object oriented programming paradigm, create classes with properties and methods and take advantage of OOP to keep their code DRY.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will have:

1. A score of 80% or higher in this module on Proctor.
