# Outcome 1 - Familiarity and Comfort with Computer Science

**Skill Description**
----------
Aspiring Andelans can identify who a computer scientist is and what a computer scientist does. They can differentiate a programmer from a computer scientist. They are also able to do independent research on the possibilities and applications of computer science and can explain findings to other learners.



**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create:

1. A screenshot of a score of 80% or higher in the computer science module on Proctor.
