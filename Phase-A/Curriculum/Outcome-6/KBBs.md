# Recursion - KBBs

## Knowledge
1. Definition of an Algorithm
2. The importance of algorithms.
3. What is algorithm analysis?
4. The Big O notation and how it is calculated
5. How to implement algorithms in Python



  
## Behaviors
1. When faced with an infinite recursion, I implement the right control structure to stop the recursion.
2. When faced with a recursive function, I am able to identify the recursive function.
3. When given a problem set that requires some sort of recursion, I am able to identify whether iteration or recursion would be suitable.
4. When given a recursive function, I am able to implement the same function using iterations.
5. When given a recursive problem set, I am able to implement recursion and iteration in Python.





## Beliefs
1. I believe that recursion has disadvantages and should be used appropriately.
2. I believe in using iteration over recursion where needed.
3. I believe that recursion when not used appropriately can cause inefficiency in a program.
