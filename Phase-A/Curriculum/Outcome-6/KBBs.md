| When to use recursive functions. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| What are recursive functions? | [ ] | [ ]  |
| How to prevent an infinite recursion.    | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Advantages and disadvantages of recursion.     | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When faced with an infinite recursion **Action:** I implement the right control structure to stop the recursion. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When faced with a recursive function, **Action:** I am able to identify the recursive function. |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** When given a problem set that requires looping **Action:** I am able to identify whether iteration or recursion would be suitable. |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** When given a recursive function **Action:** I am able to implement the same function using iteration. |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** When given an iterative function that can be recursive. **Action:** I am able to implement the same function using recursion. |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** When given a problem set that requires looping **Action:** I am able to implement recursion and iteration in Python. |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that recursion has disadvantages and should be used appropriately. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| I believe in using iteration over recursion where needed. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| I believe that recursion when not used appropriately can cause inefficiency in a program. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| I believe that many algorithms can be expressed much more elegantly recursively than iteratively. | [ ] | [ ]  |
