# Outcome 8 - Sorting and Searching

**Skill Description**
----------
Aspiring Andelans know several sorting and searching algorithms. They determine which of the searching or sorting algorithms is efficient for the problem at hand and implement the algorithm using Python.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will have:

1. A score of 80% or higher in the sorting and searching module on Proctor.
