# Outcome 8 - Software Engineering

**Skill Description**
----------
By the end of Phase A - Homestudy, aspiring Andelans should be able to adopt a software development cycle (SDLC) model while developing a software. This means that they are able to understand several SLDC models and phases.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to:

1. Complete and pass Proctor assessment that tests knowledge on Software engineering.


**Objectives**

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When working on software development team **Action:** I recommend using a SDLC model to the team before development. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When given a software to develop **Action:** I identify the SDLC model that best suits the team and project. |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** When given a software to develop **Action:** I identify the roles of a software engineer for the project. |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** When given a software to develop **Action:** I involve a software engineer in the development process. |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| There is no SDLC without a software engineer and vice versa. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| A good software is built with a software engineer and an SDLC model being part of the process.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| Software development process is easier with a software engineer involved in the process. | [ ] | [ ]  |
