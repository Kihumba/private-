# Outcome 8 - Software Engineering

**Skill Description**
----------
By the end of Phase A - Homestudy, aspiring Andelans should be able to adopt a software development cycle (SDLC) model while developing a software. This means that they are able to understand several SLDC models and phases.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to:

1. Complete and pass Proctor assessment that tests knowledge on Software engineering.
