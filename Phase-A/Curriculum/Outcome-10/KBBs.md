## Behaviors
1. When creating a web page, I layout all the required components on the page using semantic HTML syntax.
2. When creating a web page, I link external CSS and Javascript to the page using the link and script tags.

4. When I want to add behaviour to my HTML elements, I make use of Javascript.
5. When building a web application, I structure the application using the MVC pattern.
6. When building a web application, I define routes and map them to specific functionality in my controller.
7. When returning data from my controller functions, I use the appropriate HTTP codes to flag errors.
8. When creating controller actions, I effectively apply programming logic for data validation and integrity.
9. When rendering HTML, I make use of the view to render data gotten from the controller.



## Beliefs
1. I believe that using frontend technology, I can replicate any web design I can imagine.
2. I believe that frontend technology has to do with everything that the user can see.
3. I believe that using frontend technology, I am able to make my application react to any user action using javascript event listeners.
4. I believe I can successfully apply relevant programming logic when building an web application.
