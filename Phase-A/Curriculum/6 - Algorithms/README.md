# Outcome 6 - Algorithms

**Skill Description**
----------
Aspiring Andelans understand what an algorithm is and how to implement algorithms in Python. They determine and analyze which algorithm is the most efficient for a particular problem using the big O notation.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will have:

1. A score of 80% or higher in the algorithms module on Proctor.
