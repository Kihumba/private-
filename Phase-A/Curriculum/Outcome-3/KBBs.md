# Object Oriented Programming - KBBs
**Summary:** The following are the Knowledge, Behaviors, and Beliefs associated with the object oriented programming module. They should have been engaged with by the end of Homestudy.

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Given a problem **Action:** I attempt to identify all the objects, their properties and their behaviours. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When modelling an object **Action:** I define my attributes as variables and behaviour as methods within my class. |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** When doing OOP data modelling **Action:** I strive to ensure my code is DRY by building reusable components. |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** When doing OOP data modelling **Action:** I take advantage of Inheritance to ensure I am reusing code as much as possible. |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that modelling my code design in an object oriented way helps me think about problems better and helps me write sustainable and reusable program components. | [ ] | [ ]  |
