# Object Oriented Programming - KBBs

## Knowledge
1. Definition of a class and an object.
2. Definition of common OOP principles and concepts:
	+ Inheritance
	+ Encapsulation
	+ Polymorphism
	+ Constructor
	+ Destructor
	+ Instance Variables
	+ Class and Static methods
3. Implement the above OOP concepts using Python
4. Give examples of where OOP can be successfully applied.



  
## Behaviors
1. Given a problem, I attempt to identify all the objects, their properties and their behaviours.
2. When modelling an object, I define my attributes as variables and behaviour as methods within my class.
3. I strive to ensure my code is DRY by building reusable components.
4. When doing OOP data modelling, I take advantage of Inheritance to ensure I am reusing code as much as possible.




## Beliefs
1. I believe that modelling my code design in an object oriented way helps me think about problems better and helps me write sustainable and reusable program components.
