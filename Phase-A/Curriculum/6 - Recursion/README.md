# Outcome 6 - Recursion

**Skill Description**
----------
By the end of Phase A - Homestudy, aspiring Andelans should understand what a recursive function is, why recursion is necessary and how recursion differs from iteration. They can also implement recursion and iteration in Python.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to:

1. Complete and pass Proctor assessment that tests knowledge on Recursion.

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Recursion has disadvantages and should be used appropriately. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Iteration over recursion where needed. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Recursion when not used appropriately can cause inefficiency in a program. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Many algorithms can be expressed much more elegantly recursively than iteratively. | [ ] | [ ]  |
