# Output 3- Build an Application with React 

- **The Product:** Using React as your front end framework and either Node/Express or Django as your back end framework, build a real-world app that enables users to share their knowledge. Before you begin building, make sure you outline your program’s requirements to help you decide on which language or framework you want to use. <br>
- **The Process:** You can choose to fork this repo to do so (more information here) and connect to their live API to facilitate the process.   <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** When you’re done building your application, make sure you **test and debug** the app completely. Then distribute it to a group of Andelans to get their user feedback. Who knows, maybe Andela will want to keep building on your product and using it forever if it’s really amazing….

>> 1. Does this sound too easy? Don’t get bored, add in Output 4! Or skip all the way to Output 5.  
>> 2. Does this sound challenging? Great! Get to work, using the below KBB’s and resource links to help as needed. 
>>  3. Does this sound like gibberish? You may not be ready for this task. [Try focusing on just React first](https://github.com/andela/learningmap/blob/master/Phase-C/JavaScript%20D2/Curriculum/11-%20Intro%20to%20React/README.md).

| **"KBB's"** <br> _What do experts think, do, and feel as they work through this task?_|
|----------|
| </br>| 
| **Knowledge**	| 
| Benefits and drawbacks of React as a front end framework	|  
| Benefits and drawbacks of Django as a back end framework | 
| Important considerations to outline when choosing a front end and back end framework	|
| How to outline your application’s architecture in “plain English” | 
| </br> | 
| **Behaviors** 	| 
|  **Context:** When I am setting up a new project, **Action:** I determine how scalable it needs to be, how fast it needs to be, how quickly it needs to be up and running, and what databases I will be connecting to. 	|  
| **Context:** Once I have the requirements of my applications outlined, **Action:** I choose front end, back end, and state management frameworks that most effectively fit my needs. 	|
| **Context:** When I want a structured back end framework with easy API endpoints, **Action:** I use Django my back end framework.|  
| **Context:** When I don’t yet know a programming framework or language, **Action:** I always take the opportunity to dive in and learn it!  | 
| </br> | 
| **Beliefs**	| 
| Thinking ahead is critical when choosing a software stack-- I should always outline my program and its requirements in plain English before diving into the code. |  
| When I can jump in and learn any new JavaScript framework or language with ease, I know that I am a D3 JavaScript developer!	|
