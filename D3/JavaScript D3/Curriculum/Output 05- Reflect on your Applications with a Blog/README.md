# Output 05- Reflect on your Applications with a Blog

- **The Product:** One of the qualities of a senior developer is that they are constantly maintaining, growing, and sharing their knowledge. <br>
- **The Process:** Take some time to reflect on the two apps that you built using different frameworks, making note of the relative benefits/drawbacks of different frameworks and examples of when each of them might be useful in future applications.  <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** Also take some time to dig into what’s new in the world of JavaScript by following leaders in the industry on Twitter, blogs, books, etc. 

>> **Optional & Recommended:** 
>> Write a blog post that discusses your reflections and insights you gained by building with different framework combinations, and from the research you did about new and upcoming JavaScript specs and libraries. Publish in whatever format you choose-- If you get it approved by some publications, you could even make some money from it! $$
