# UI / UX Awareness & Design

## Skill Description
A person with this skill is familiar enough with the principles of UI/UX design that they can identify a flaw in design and suggest improvements to it. They have spent enough time thoughtfully learning about and looking at product design that they have developed an intuition about good design, and can back it up with scientific or user research-driven data.  

## Output: 
Taking your current product as an example, suggest 2-3 design improvements. Why would you change these? What design principles are you drawing on? How might you research these changes to see if they were impactful for your users? 

## Output 2: 
Use a different product every day as an end user. As you use it, note the user stories you passed through, and any areas where there were flaws in design that you could improve. The more you do this, the more intuitive your design sense will become!
