# Output 2 - Algorithms

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can implement high-performance data entry and data retrieval over complex structured data sets. They can recognize and code programming solutions using the appropriate algorithms. 

## Output
- **Task:** Make a list of *at minimum* five algorithm types you might use in your work, and map them to examples of when they would be used. 
- **Resources:** You can represent them however you wish-- through diagrams, written words, etc.  
- **Include:** Reflect with a colleague or teammate to see if they came up with any ideas you missed

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am deciding which algorithm is best for my dataset, **Action:** I start by looking at the process that generated the data.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** After looking at the processes that generated my data, **Action:** I consider how many training points and how many features my dataset has.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am deciding between several algorithms that could work, **Action:** I consider whether my model is robust enough to deal with the number of outliers my data has, and whether my model matches the assumptions of the problem at hand.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I need to quickly come up with an index for some data, **Action:** I use a hash algorithm.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When selecting a hash algorithm, **Action:** I choose one with a minute propensity for collision.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
