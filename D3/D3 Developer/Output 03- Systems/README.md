# Output 3- Systems

## Skill Description 
A person with this skill can explain how the front end, back end, and hardware interact to create a functional application, and uses that knowledge to create effective code architecture. They are able to work with systems to ensure the security of their application or program. 

## Output 
- **Task:** On a new or existing application, add in memory caching and authentication functionality  for security. 
- **Resources:** You can choose whatever method you feel is most appropriate for each.
- **Include:** N/A

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I have more than one process that share the same library, **Action:** I use dynamic linking.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to reduce the total consumption of memory (disk space, RAM, cache), **Action:** I use dynamic linking.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have data that will persist in my application, **Action:** I implement appropriate storage and memory usage based on the language and the amount of data being stored.  | [ ] | [ ]  |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Understanding how systems are built from the ground up gives me a holistic edge when thinking about ways I could design a performant system or improve the performance of existing systems.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
