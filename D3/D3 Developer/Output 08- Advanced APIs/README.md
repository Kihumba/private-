# Output 8- Advanced APIs

## Skill Description 
A person with this skill can design, build, and work with complex APIs. When needed, they write libraries to simplify frequently used tasks or to fill in the gaps of an existing API. 

## Output 
- **Task:** Design and build a basic API for a real-world problem or program you are working on. 
- **Resources:** Use REST protocol in your build and design
- **Include:** N/A

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I notice that I am repeating a few API tasks over and over, **Action:** I create a library that helps simplify them. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When there is a gap in how I want to use my API, **Action:** I create a library to fill that gap. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I need to achieve backward-compatibility with an API, **Action:** I consider whether I can do so by simply adding new parameters or methods. | [ ] | [ ]  |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| APIs age just like we doâ€¦ and we must be prepared to evolve them as new bugs and dependencies arise. | [ ] | [ ]  |
