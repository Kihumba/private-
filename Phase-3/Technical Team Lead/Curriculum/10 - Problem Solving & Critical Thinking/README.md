# Outcome 10 - Problem Solving & Critical Thinking

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow is able to display logical reasoning by drawing inferences that can be correlated to facts gathered, and prediction by extrapolating potential outcomes of solutions to identify risks and unintended consequences.

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. A risk assessment document that covers observations, assumptions, and predictions of a potential decision on a simulation project


**Objectives**
----------
## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe, from memory, common types of testing, including the following: | | |
| * Risk Assessment| [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Roles of observations, assumptions and predictions in risk assessment | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I present ideas/solutions **Action:** I present them with facts that the solutions are based on and facts that the ideas could be correlated with  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I make predictions/recommendations **Action:** I highlight potential risks/unintended consequences of the recommendations |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |

----------


## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that my ideas will be more compelling if I base them on facts and offer predictions that account for vulnerability | [ ] | [ ]  |
