# Outcome 10 - Problem Solving & Critical Thinking

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow is able to display logical reasoning by drawing inferences that can be correlated to facts gathered, and prediction by extrapolating potential outcomes of solutions to identify risks and unintended consequences.

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. A risk assessment document that covers observations, assumptions, and predictions of a potential decision on a project


**Objectives**
----------

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am solving a problem **Action:** I gather facts to support my solution design  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I gather facts **Action:** I draw inferences based on those facts  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I present ideas/solutions **Action:** I present them with facts that the solutions are based on and facts that the ideas could be correlated with  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I present ideas/solutions **Action:** I offer multiple predicted outcomes |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I make predictions/recommendations **Action:** I highlight potential pitfalls of the recommendations and address them |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I encounter new problems **Action:** I consider and leverage solutions/results from my prior experiences that may be similar |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| My ideas will be more compelling if they are based on facts, offer multiple predicted outcomes, and address potential pitfalls | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Risk is inevitable, it is my job to anticipate potential risks and work to mitigate their impact | [ ] | [ ]  |
| It is rare to know all the facts before making a decision and that it is okay to make a decision based on assumptions and inferences | [ ] | [ ]  |
| My prior experiences are a valuable resource for making effective inferences in new situations | [ ] | [ ]  |
