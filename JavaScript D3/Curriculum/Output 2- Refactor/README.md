# Output 2- Refactor

- **The Product:** Now that you have a working application, go back and refactor it! This is always a critical step. You may think it’s perfect, but take the time to profile both your back end and server-side code for performance and memory leaks.  <br>
- **The Process:** Make sure that your code is idiomatic, clear, and that your various components interface smoothly. Make sure your code structure and file structure are hyper-organized and so clear that any person could pick it up and understand it-- even if they’re not a developer! <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** If you don’t find anything to refactor… you aren’t looking hard enough! :)

-----------------------------------------------------------
>> Find your ZPD: 
>> 
>> 1. Does this sound too easy? You’re probably not looking hard enough for your refactoring possibilities-- share your app with a friend and see what feedback they can give you! 
>> 2. Does this sound challenging? Great! Get to work, using the below KBB’s and resource links to help as needed. 
>>  3. Does this sound like gibberish? You may not be ready for this task. Try the output in the “JavaScript D1- Writing Clean Code” objective first.

| **Knowledge**	| 
| How to profile back end code for performance & memory leaks	|  
| How to profile server side code for performance & memory leaks |

| </br> | 
| **Behaviors** 	| 
|  **Context:** When I have a working application, **Action:** I go back and refactor to optimize for code structure and clarity, performance, and security. |  
| **Context:** When I am refactoring my code for a JavaScript program, **Action:** I use modularity to break it into different functions.	|
| **Context:** When I have duplicate code in my program, **Action:** I refactor using abstraction. | 
| **Context:** When I am refactoring my application, **Action:** I check to make sure that each function does one thing, and one thing only. |
| </br> | 
| **Beliefs**	| 
| Every piece of software starts as a rough draft-- I can always make my code cleaner and better. |  
| Any amount of milliseconds of processing time (for a computer or for a human working with my code) adds friction to my application, and is a cost to be considered. 	|  
| A novice seeks completion. An expert developer knows that an app will always grow and improve, and hungers for that improvement. |
