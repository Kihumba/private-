# Output 6- Build an App of your Choice

- **The Product:** Using any front end framework and any state management/back end framework, build an application that solves real-world problem (at Andela or in your broader community so that you can use real-world users!)  <br>
- **The Process:** Sketch out how you would build it using the most appropriate architecture and JavaScript stacks based on the goals and size of your future application.   <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** Build in security features to close the application off to Andelans only and to protect from hackers. Use test driven development and continuous delivery during your build process. 
When you’re done with the app distribute it to a group of Andelans to get user feedback.  Maybe they’ll keep using it forever!
