# Output 4- Add a Chat Functionality to an App

- **The Product:** On either of the apps you’ve built (or another JavaScript-based app entirely, if you choose) build in a chat functionality that allows users to interact with each other in real time.  <br>
- **The Process:** You can choose to build it so that it would easily plug into a current Andela product as well for real-user consequence.   <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** Make sure you get real users to test/ use your application and reflect/refactor based on their feedback.

| **Knowledge**	| 
| Best JavaScript languages/frameworks for “real-time” applications	|  
| Benefits and drawbacks of using Socket.io for real-time applications | 
| </br> | 
| **Behaviors** 	| 
|  **Context:** When I am building a service to include in my application, **Action:** I keep my users in the front of my mind and optimize for their experience.  	|

| **Beliefs**	| 
| I write software for people, and code for developers.  |  
| Without users, there is no reason to build-- I should always aim to get real users on my application.	|
