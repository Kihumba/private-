# Outcome 7 - Recursion

**Skill Description**
----------
Aspiring Andelans understand what a recursive function is, why recursion is necessary and how recursion differs from iteration. They know the advantages and disadvantages of recursion as well as when to use recursion over iteration and vice versa. They can also write recursive and iterative functions using Python.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will have:

1. A score of 80% or higher in the recursion module on Proctor.
