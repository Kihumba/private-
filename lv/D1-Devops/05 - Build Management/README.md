# Outcome 05 - Build Management

Skill Description
------------------
A person with this skill can effectively execute the process of managing and automating a build system. 


Outputs
----------
- **Task:** On a new or existing project, set up a pipeline to automate the build process by automatically generating builds for every commit to a repository.
- **Resources:** Use a configuration tool of your choice
- **Include:** You can pair program, or ask a fellow Developer for a project to work with for more “real world” practice.

## **Beliefs**

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt          | Demonstrated |
|:------------------|:------------------:|:------------:|
| A software build is immutable | [ ] | [ ] |
| Changes to the software code result in a new build | [ ] | [ ] |
| A software build should be reproducible | [ ] | [ ] |
| A broken build must be immediately fixed or there will be trickle-down consequences | [ ] | [ ] |
