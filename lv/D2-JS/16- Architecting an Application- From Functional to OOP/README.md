# Outcome 16- Architecting an Application: From Functional to Object Oriented Programming

## Skill Description
A person with this skill writes idiomatic, clear, object oriented JavaScript code that is easy to build onto. 

## Output 
- **Task:** Take an application that you have been programming functionally and outline how you would re-write it in an Object Oriented Style. 
- **Resources:** Reflect on the changes, and decide which version is more practical. Write a short explanation of why this is. 
- **Include:** If you decided your application would be more effective in OOP, refactor it. If not, practice OOP JavaScript by building a simple CRUD application.
