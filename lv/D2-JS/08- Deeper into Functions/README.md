# Outcome 8- Deeper into Functions: IIFE, Closures & Lexical Scope

## Skill Description
A person with this skill takes their understanding of functional programming in JavaScript one level deeper. They can explain the importance of the “IIFE” concept, and why it is considered a best practice for JavaScript developers. 


## Output
-**Task:** Write a simple JavaScript library that helps simplify a common task you do in your programming. 
-**Resources:** Use the IIFE pattern when creating the library.
-**Include:** Share with a fellow programmer and make sure they can insert your library into their code without unwanted interaction. Get feedback on how useful it is!

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to capture a value from a function for later use, **Action:** I use a closure.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to do the same thing multiple times in my JavaScript application, **Action:** I use a closure
| **Context:** When I write a function in JavaScript, **Action:** I am creating a scope.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I write a function that I want to keep isolated from its outer scope, **Action:** I use the IIFE pattern.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I am writing a function that could be transferred to another code base (eg. when I am writing a JavaScript library), **Action:** I use the IIFE pattern.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Functional programming gets more important the more advanced I get in JavaScript.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Using IIFE is a best practice for any JavaScript programming. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| The IIFE pattern allows me to keep control of my code, no matter what might surround it.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Some libraries implement closures a lot-- by understanding closures I am more flexible in my use of JavaScript libraries.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
