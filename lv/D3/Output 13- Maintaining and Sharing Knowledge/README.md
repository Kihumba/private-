# Output 13- Maintaining and Sharing Knowledge

## Skill Description
A person with this skill keeps on the absolute forefront of upcoming technologies and products. They are constantly exploring, playing with previews of new technologies, and practicing builds in new stacks. They have best-in-class research skills and can find the information needed to solve any problem. Most importantly, they share their knowledge with others daily through mentorship, conversation, and blogs. 

## Output
- **Task:** Reflect on a time that you needed to solve a programming problem that you did not know how to accomplish. Outline the research steps you took to uncover the needed information to build a solution.
- **Resources:** Use whatever medium you choose. 
- **Include:** Share with your team. 

## Alternative Output
- **Task:** Make a list of blogs, sites, podcasts, and books that you learn from
- **Resources:** Use whatever medium you choose. 
- **Include:** Share with your team so they, too, can learn from your sources!
