# Output 1- Advanced Data Structures

## Skill Description: 
A person with this skill makes use of advanced data structures in their programming. They should not necessarily be building data structures from scratch, but should be able to implement them with ease. They are able to immediately explain which data structure makes the most sense for their programming goal, and can describe real-life problems whose solutions have implemented common data structures. 

>> **Note:** *Many of these are a review of D2, but you should take time to refresh your memory to deepen your ability to use these with fluency.*


## Output: 
- **Task:** Make a list of *at minimum* five data structures you might use in your work, and map them to examples of when they would be used. 
- **Resources:** You can represent them however you wish-- through diagrams, written words, etc.  
- **Include:** Reflect with a colleague or teammate to see if they came up with any ideas you missed

### Behavior
| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am deciding what data structure to use, **Action:** I first consider whether it will “fit” my problem. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** Once I decide on possible structures that fit my problem, **Action:** I consider implementation challenges such as performance, maturity, and supportability. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I still have multiple data structures that could work for my goal, **Action:** I consider speed and efficiency. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have a system that reads and writes large blocks of data, **Action:** I consider using a B-tree implementation. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I need dynamic memory, **Action:** I use heaps. | [ ] | [ ]  |

### Belief
| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Knowing which data structure to use does not mean I must write them from scratch-- implementation saves me that trouble. | [ ] | [ ]  |
