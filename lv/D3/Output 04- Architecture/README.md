# Output 4- Architecture

## Skill Description
A person with this skill is aware of the various system architectures available to them when developing a new application, and are capable of contributing to a system already architected following any pattern. 

## Output
- **Task:** Using a code base that has been written either by your own team or by an open source community, outline how you could refactor the code base using different architectural patterns that were not used in the original code base.
- **Resources:** Reflect on why you would make the change and what benefits and drawbacks it would entail. 
- **Include:** N/A

## Alternative Output
- **Task:** Determine a real-world problem that you would like to solve through a new software or application. 
- **Resources:** Sketch out how you would build it using the most appropriate architecture based on the goals and size of your future application. 
- **Include:** Collaborate with a colleague or teammate to get their feedback on the architectural pattern you chose.
