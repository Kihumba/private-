# Output 7- Testing & Defensive Coding

## Skill Description
A person with this skill always plans their code around testing, exception checking, and anticipating failure. They are meticulous about having bug-free code, and may even have their own library to help with defensive coding. 
>> **Note:** *All Andelan developers should have testing skills-- this is repeated as a review and reminder that D3 testing skills should be impeccable. *

## Output
- **Task:** Using a new or existing program, debug thoroughly, and see what you are able to catch. Then, outline how you would re-build the program using TDD. 
- **Resources:** Use any type of testing you deem most appropriate. 
- **Include:** Compare and contrast the testing results of the two approaches and reflect with your team.
