# Outcome 13- Network Operations for Android

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can explain the fundamentals of Network Operations and how they interact with their Android application. Through this knowledge they are able to create applications that can efficiently use, share, and interact with data. 

## Output
- **Task:** Create an Android app that allows users to upload, store, and interact with data files (eg. photos, videos, music, etc.) 
- **Resources:** Use the data format and library of your choice, and be able to explain why each is the most effective. 
- **Include:** N/A

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am architecting my Android app **Action:** I ensure that I build in a security component. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am building an app that needs to restrict access to user data **Action:** I implement user-granted permissions. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making network calls on my application **Action:** I consider whether they are necessary and worth the data they might cost my user. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to minimize the data my phone is using **Action:** I implement push notifications from the server. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** If my application is fetching data all the time **Action:** I introduce persistence. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am dealing with sensitive information (such as a user password) **Action:** I use encryption when communicating with the server. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have a functioning Android app **Action:** I test for battery performance to optimize its efficiency. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Effective use of network operations is the key to being a good Android developer-- I cannot avoid interacting with a network, so I may as well master it! | [ ] | [ ] |
| A secure app is a useable app. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Battery performance is an important aspect of an effective Android app-- if my application makes the device it is running on die, no one can use it. | [ ] | [ ] |
