# Outcome 4 - Callbacks and Closures

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can effectively implement both callbacks and closures in PHP program, and can explain how they work with anonymous functions. 

## Outputs
----------
Create a PHP program that uses callbacks and closures in the place of defining a function. Alternatively, you can edit an existing PHP program you are working on to replace a function with callbacks and closures.

## Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am creating a function that has no specified name in my PHP app **Action:** I use lambdas to pass functions as arguments to other functions. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am writing a PHP program that involves passing functions as arguments **Action:**  I use callbacks and closures. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I am writing callbacks in a PHP program **Action:** I type-hint them with the callback type.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I am writing closures in a PHP program **Action:** I type-hint them with the closure class.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
