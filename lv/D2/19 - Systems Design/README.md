# Outcome 19 - Systems Design

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow demonstrates an understanding of how design decisions are made in software development and trade-offs between stacks and technologies

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. Document explaining all types of design decisions made on a project e.g database decisions, UX implementations, stacks/technologies etc.

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before I start building applications **Action:** I analyze the application needs/requirements | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** After analyzing the system needs/requirements **Action:** I draw an architecture model that illustrates the needed system components and how they interact with each other | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** After drawing the architecture model **Action:** I choose the optimal language, frameworks, databases for each system component | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When designing each system component **Action:** I ensure that it is loosely coupled with other components while allowing other components to interact with it in a cohesive manner | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When designing each system component **Action:** I modularize my code | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I build better tools when I advocate for the best tool for the job | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Investing time to select the optimal technologies for a new system helps me build more durable applications for the long term | [ ] | [ ]  |
