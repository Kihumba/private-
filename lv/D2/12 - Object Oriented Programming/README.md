# Outcome 12 - Object Oriented Programming

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands the SOLID (Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation and Dependency inversion) principles of object oriented programming and knows how to refactor code to align with SOLID.

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. Object-oriented programs that adhere to the SOLID principle

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Whenever I create a Class **Action:** I ensure that it has only one job | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** Whenever I build object-oriented programs **Action:** I use interfaces to adhere to the Open-Closed principle | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** Whenever I create an interface **Action:** I design it so it does not force its clients to depend on methods they do not need | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** Whenever I create a derived Class **Action:** I write it to be substitutable for its base/parent class | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I design object-oriented programs **Action:** I design my modules to rely on abstractions rather than other modules | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Adhering to the SOLID principles make my code more modular, reusable and extendable | [ ] | [ ]  |
