# Outcome 2 - Token-Based Authentication

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow will be able to use token-based authentication to ensure that each request to a server is accompanied by a "token," and thus verified for authenticity. 


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create a Python web app that implements token-based authentication. 


**Objectives**

## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The differences between Token-Based Authentication and Server-Based Authentication | [ ] | [ ] |
| The steps involved in Token-Based Authentication| [ ] | [ ] |
| Pros and Cons of Token-Based Authentication | [ ] | [ ] |
| Anatomy of a JWT Token (Header, Payload and Signature) and what each section contains | [ ] | [ ] |
| Process of encoding and decoding JWT Token | [ ] | [ ] |

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to implement stateless transactions on my application **Action:** I make use Token-Based Authentication. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After creating a token for my user **Action:** I always ensure that I store the token on the client for subsequent requests. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making use of Token-Based Authentication **Action:** I add the token to the `Authorization` Header of every HTTP request of a protected route. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to create a public API that makes use of Token-Based Authentication **Action:** I allow my server accept requests from all domains using `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When creating tokens **Action:** I encode enough data to identify the user from the token. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When creating tokens **Action:** I always ensure that I set a reasonable expiration time for my tokens. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When using tokens in my web application **Action:** I encode the data using the key and use the same key to decode the token. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When validating tokens **Action:** I always check that the token is valid, not expired, and has the appropriate user data. | [ ] | [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Token-Based Authentication can and will reduce the processing load on my server. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Security is critical to the functionality of my app. | [ ] | [ ] |
| My application is much more scalable when I use Token-Based Authentication. | [ ] | [ ] |
