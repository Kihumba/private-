# Outcome 1 - Version Control

**Skill Description**
----------
By the end of Phase B - Bootcamp, aspiring Andelans should be about 30% of the way to client readiness with version control. This means they can build and manage personal and shared repos using conventional git workflows and Github.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will be able to create the following:

1. A blog post on what the HEAD is and how it’s important
2. A personal repo with at least 5 commits
3. A shared repo with commits
    - It will be great to see conflicts and at least one merge


**Objectives**
----------

## **Behaviors**


### Git Workflow
| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Whenever I’m setting up Git on a new machine **Action:** I ensure I've setup my SSH keys. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When creating a project that I intend to revisit **Action:** I create a new remote repository on Github and pull down to my local repository. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am about to continue work on an ongoing project **Action:** I pull in changes from the remote repository. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** After I update my codebase with working code **Action:** I make a commit. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** After every commit **Action:** I push the changes to Github. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When making a commit **Action:** I include a commit message that describes exactly what I did and that will be interpretable by another developer. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When I think about writing new code **Action:** I strategically decide whether or not I need to make a new branch. |  [ ]  |     [ ]  |
