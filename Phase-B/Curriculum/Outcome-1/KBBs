# Version Control - KBBs

## Knowledge 

1. What is version control? Our definition of version control versus leaving it to the bootcamper to find out what it is.
2. Possible use cases of version control
3. Other example version control systems apart from Git
4. Github as a web based repository hosting services
5. The commands needed in a Git workflow (pull, push, branch, commit, merge, status)
6. When I am working collaboratively there is a likelihood of having merge conflict which can be resolved.
7. What the HEAD is in Git and how it’s important.

## Behaviors

### Git Workflow

1. Whenever I’m setting up Git on a new machine I ensure I setup my SSH keys.
2. When creating a project that I intend to revisit, I create a new remote repository on Github and pull down to my local repository.
3. When I am about to continue work on an ongoing project, I pull in changes from the remote repository.
4. After I update my codebase with working code, I make a commit.
5. After every commit, I push the changes to Github.
6. When making a commit I include a commit message that describes exactly what I did and that will be interpretable by another developer.
7. When I think about writing new code, I think about whether or not I need a branch.


## Beliefs

1. I believe that branching creates a safe space to try new things when I’m implementing a new feature.
2. I believe using Git for my personal project is very valuable for tracking my progress.
