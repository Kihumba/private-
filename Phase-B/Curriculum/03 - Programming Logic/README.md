# Outcome 3 - Programming Logic

**Skill Description**
----------
Aspiring Andelans should understand the fundamentals of how to break down problems into programmable logic, and be able to write reusable functions. Additionally, they will be able to identify common problem areas where the performance of a program might be affected.


**Outputs**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

1. 7 Andelab Bootcamp exercises completed.
2. 2 in-class code katas solved.
	- Function to generate prime numbers from 0 to n
	- Function to generate Fibonacci sequence from 0 to n


**Objectives**
----------

## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |
| * What a function is | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Examples of where we can make use of reusable functions |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| * How to write a function in a given programming language | [ ] |    [ ] |
| * What a return value is | [ ] |    [ ] |
| * How to pass return values across different functions | [ ] |    [ ] |
| * How to break down problems into inputs, processes and outputs | [ ] |    [ ] |
| * Common things to look out for that can affect the performance of my program | [ ] |    [ ] |
| * Best practices for naming of functions and variables in my program | [ ] |    [ ] |

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am writing logic that is repeated in my codebase **Action:** I make use of functions to facilitate reuse of code | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I write a function **Action:** I return a value that represents the desired output for that function | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am faced with a programming challenge **Action:** I break it down into a series of steps that can be represented using functions |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** After writing a working program, before delivering **Action:** I always check to see if there are ways to make it run faster and/or conserve system resources like internet bandwith or memory | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am writing code **Action:** I follow best practices with respect to naming and code organization to make sure my code is easy to read and understand for the next developer who will work on it | [ ] |    [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Programming languages may differ but the core logic behind how programs and computers work are the same | [ ] | [ ] |
| I solve problems. My computer follows instructions. Together we can impact the world | [ ] | [ ] |
