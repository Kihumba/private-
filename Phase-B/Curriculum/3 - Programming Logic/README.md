# Outcome 3 - Programming Logic

**Skill Description**
----------
By the end of Phase B - Bootcamp, aspiring Andelans should be about 20% of the way to client readiness with programming logic. This means they can understand fundamentally how to break down problems into programmable logic while also being able to write and use functions properly to facilitate reuse. In addition to this, they will be able to identify common problem areas where the performance of a program might be affected.


**Outputs**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. At least 5 Easy Hackerrank code katas solved.
2. At least 2 Medium Hackerrank code katas solved.


**Objectives**

## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Define a function | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Give examples of where we can make use of reusable functions. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| How to write a function in a given programming language. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| What a return value is. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| How to pass return values across different functions. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| Common things to look out for that can affect the performance of my program. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| Best practices for naming of functions and variables in my program. | [ ] |    [ ] |


----------


## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am faced with a problem... **Action:** I make use of functions to facilitate reuse of code. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I write a function... **Action:** I return a value that represents the desired output for that function | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am faced with a problem... **Action:** I break it down into a series of steps that can be represented using functions. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** After writing a program... **Action:** I always check to see if there are ways to make it run faster and/or conserve system resources like internet connection or memory. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am writing a program... **Action:** I follow best practices with respect to naming and code organization to make sure my code is easy to read and understand for the next developer who will work on it | [ ] |    [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that I can automate most tasks that are repetitive in nature using programming. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| I believe that programming languages may differ but the core logic behind how programs and computers work are the same. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I believe the computer is a machine that will operate based instruction and I have to be very explicit about giving instructions. I define the operations for it to perform, checks for input data and how to present output to users. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I believe that using the right data types goes a long way towards improving my overall application speed and quality. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I believe that programs are written for humans to read and for computers to execute. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
