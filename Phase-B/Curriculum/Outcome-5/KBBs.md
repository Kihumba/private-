## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Definition of Test Driven Development. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Pros and Cons of using the TDD approach to developing applications |   [ ]   |   [ ] |

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am creating new functionality... **Action:** I define my test before I define my function. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When writing test cases... **Action:** I identify all the possible edge cases and write my tests to take care of these cases. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When building out any application... **Action:**  I write test, let them fail, before adding in code to make the tests pass. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When building an application... **Action:** I make sure to get as close as possible to 100% test coverage. | [ ] |    [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that my program can have 100% test coverage. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I believe that writing tests reduces the risk of my program malfunctioning in the future. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I believe that writing tests help me better define the specs of an application Iâ€™m building. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I believe that my application will be considered more stable if I have solid test coverage. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I believe that following TDD practice will make me a better programmer. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
