# Outcome 7 - HTTP and Web Services

**Skill Description**
----------
By the end of Phase B - Bootcamp, aspiring Andelans should be about 20% of the way to client readiness with HTTP and Web Services. This means they know what the Request-Response Cycle is, the difference between clients and servers and how APIs and web services operate.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will be able to create the following:

1. A simple command line application that consumes a Public API using a HTTP client library.

## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |
| * How a URL gets routed to a web application (HTTP Request-Response Life Cycle). | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Common HTTP Verbs and typical use cases - `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH` |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| * Differences between the client and the server. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| * Examples of clients and servers and a high-level view of how they operate. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| * Different HTTP Status codes and what they mean. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| * Common security threats to web applications. (See [here](https://securityintelligence.com/the-10-most-common-application-attacks-in-action/)) | [ ] |    [ ] |

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am trying to consume a 3rd Party API **Action:** I test the different request and response formats using POSTMAN/Curl/Httpie. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When trying to build an application using a publicly available HTTP API **Action:** I read the documentation thoroughly to ensure I understand the different endpoints, request types, response types and error definitions. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When consuming an API **Action:** I define request object based on the API specifications. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I see an error from an API request **Action:** I can tell what it means based on the error code I receive. | [ ] |    [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Public HTTP APIs exist to enable access to data and functionality from web services. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Different HTTP status codes exist to give me information about the type of errors that occur while trying to consume the API. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Multiple clients can access data from a single server. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Multiple clients can be built on different platforms (mobile, desktop, embedded system) to consume data and functionality via an HTTP API. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
