# Outcome 7 - HTTP and Web Services

**Skill Description**
----------
Aspiring Andelans should know what the *Request-Response Cycle* is, the difference between clients and servers, and how APIs and web services operate.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

1. A simple command line application that consumes a Public API using a HTTP client library.


**Objectives**
----------

## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |
| * How a URL gets routed to a web application (HTTP Request-Response Life Cycle) | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Common HTTP verbs and typical use cases |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| * Differences between the client and the server | [ ] |    [ ] |
| * Examples of clients and servers and a high-level view of how they operate | [ ] |    [ ] |
| * Different HTTP status codes and what they mean | [ ] |    [ ] |

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am trying to consume a 3rd Party API **Action:** I test the different request and response formats using POSTMAN/Curl/Httpie | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When trying to build an application that uses a publicly available HTTP API **Action:** I read the documentation thoroughly to ensure I understand the different endpoints, request types, response types and error definitions | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to send a request to an API **Action:** I define request object based on the API specifications |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to parse response data received from an API **Action:** I ensure to parse the data based on the API specification for responses |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I see an error from an API request **Action:** I tell what it means based on the error code and message I receive | [ ] |    [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can leverage on data from APIs to create robust multi-functional applications  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| One API can serve multiple clients on different platforms |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
