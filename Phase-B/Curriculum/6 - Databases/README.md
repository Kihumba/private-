# Outcome 6 - Databases

**Skill Description**
----------
Outcome - By the end of Phase B - Bootcamp, aspiring Andelans should be about 20% of the way to client readiness with Databases. This know what SQL is, the different types of databases, examples of databases and how to design basic database tables.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. Database design for a simple database problem involving at least two tables. (Extra credit if there are relationships).
2. 5 reports generated from the data within the database.

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When faced with a data modelling problem... **Action:** I create the required table structures diagrammatically. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When a subset of data is needed from a table... **Action:** I create SQL queries to extract the specific data required. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When designing a table... **Action:**  I identify where a primary key or a foreign key is required and design appropriately. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When designing a table... **Action:** I make use of data types adequately to ensure the data stored is well formatted. | [ ] |    [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that if Iâ€™m solving a problem that requires persistent data, I should use a database. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I believe that there is not just one database solution for all data problems. (SQL is not a silver bullet). |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I believe that investing time to structure my data properly could help me create better performing applications. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
