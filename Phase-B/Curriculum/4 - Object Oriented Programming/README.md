# Outcome 4 - Object-Oriented Programming

**Skill Description**
----------
By the end of Phase B - Bootcamp, aspiring Andelans should be about 30% of the way to client readiness with Object-Oriented Programming. This know what classes and objects are, how to design simple data models and can apply object-oriented programming principles to solve basic problems.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:
1. Object Oriented Programming assignment - Model a real-world problem using OOP taking advantage of Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism and the other OOP concepts.


**Objectives**
----------

## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Definition of a class and an object. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Definition of common OOP principles and concepts: Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| List out languages that support OOP and languages that are purely procedural. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| Give examples of where OOP can be successfully applied. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| Object Oriented Programming vs Procedural Programming: Key differences and possible benefits of OOP over the latter. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| Common things to look out for that can affect the performance of my program. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| Define metaprogramming as synthesis of classes, objects and modules. | [ ] |    [ ] |


----------


## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am faced with a problem... **Action:** I attempt to identify all the objects, their properties and their behaviours. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When modelling an object... **Action:** I define my attributes as variables and behaviour as methods within my class. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am writing code... **Action:** I strive to ensure my code is DRY by building reusable components. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When doing OOP data modelling... **Action:** I take advantage of Inheritance to ensure I am reusing code as much as possible. | [ ] |    [ ] |

----------


## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that modelling my code design in an object oriented way helps me think about problems better and helps me write sustainable and reusable program components. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
