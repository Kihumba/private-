# Outcome 7 - HTTP and Web Services

**Skill Description**
----------
By the end of Phase B - Bootcamp, aspiring Andelans should be about 20% of the way to client readiness with HTTP and Web Services. This means they know what the Request-Response Cycle is, the difference between clients and servers and how APIs and web services operate.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:
1. Data wrangling assignment that involves consuming a public API using `requests`.

## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| How a URL gets routed to a web application (HTTP Request-Response Life Cycle). | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Common HTTP Verbs and typical use cases - `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH` |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Differences between the client and the server. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| Examples of clients and servers and a high-level view of how they operate. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| Different HTTP Status codes and what they mean. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| Common security threats to web applications. (See [here](https://securityintelligence.com/the-10-most-common-application-attacks-in-action/)) | [ ] |    [ ] |


----------


## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am trying to consume a 3rd Party API... **Action:** I test the different request and response formats using POSTMAN/Curl/Httpie. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When trying to build an application using a publicly available HTTP API... **Action:** I read the documentation thoroughly to ensure I understand the different endpoints, request types, response types and error definitions. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When consuming an API... **Action:**  I define request object based on the API specifications. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I see an error from an API request... **Action:** I can tell what it means based on the error code I receive. | [ ] |    [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that public HTTP APIs exist to enable access to data and functionality from web services. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I believe that the different HTTP status codes exist to give me information about the type of errors that occur while trying to consume the API. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I believe that the different HTTP verbs are mapped to respective CRUD actions. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I believe that multiple clients can access data from a single server. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I believe that multiple clients can be built on different platforms (mobile, desktop, embedded system) to consume data and functionality via an HTTP API. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
