| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Define a function | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Give examples of where we can make use of reusable functions. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| How to write a function in a given programming language. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| What a return value is. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| How to pass return values across different functions. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| Common things to look out for that can affect the performance of my program. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| Best practices for naming of functions and variables in my program. | [ ] |    [ ] |

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am faced with a problem... **Action:** I make use of functions to facilitate reuse of code. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I write a function... **Action:** I return a value that represents the desired output for that function | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am faced with a problem... **Action:** I break it down into a series of steps that can be represented using functions. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** After writing a program... **Action:** I always check to see if there are ways to make it run faster and/or conserve system resources like internet connection or memory. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am writing a program... **Action:** I follow best practices with respect to naming and code organization to make sure my code is easy to read and understand for the next developer who will work on it | [ ] |    [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that I can automate most tasks that are repetitive in nature using programming. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| I believe that programming languages may differ but the core logic behind how programs and computers work are the same. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I believe the computer is a machine that will operate based instruction and I have to be very explicit about giving instructions. I define the operations for it to perform, checks for input data and how to present output to users. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I believe that using the right data types goes a long way towards improving my overall application speed and quality. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I believe that programs are written for humans to read and for computers to execute. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
