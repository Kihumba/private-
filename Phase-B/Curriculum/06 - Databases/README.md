# Outcome 6 - Databases

**Skill Description**
----------
Outcome - By the end of Phase B - Bootcamp, aspiring Andelans should be about 20% of the way to client readiness with Databases. This know what SQL is, the different types of databases, examples of databases and how to design basic database tables.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will be able to create the following:

1. Database design for a simple database problem involving at least two tables. (Extra credit if there are relationships).
2. At least 5 reports generated from the data within the database.


**Objectives**

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When faced with a data modelling problem **Action:** I create the required table structures diagrammatically either using pencil and paper or using software. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When a subset of data is needed from a table **Action:** I create SQL queries to extract the specific data required. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When designing a table **Action:**  I always create an `id` field as the primary key. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to create table relationships **Action:**  I specify a foreign key that identifies the related record in the related table |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When designing a table **Action:** I make use of data types adequately to ensure the data stored is well formatted. | [ ] |    [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Databases should be used when Iâ€™m solving a problem that requires persistent data. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| There is not just one database solution for all data problems. (SQL is not a silver bullet). |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Investing time in structuring my data properly could help me create better performing applications. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
