# Outcome 5 - Test-Driven Development

**Skill Description**
----------
Aspiring Andelans should know what tests are, how to write them, and how the TDD approach can be beneficial in development.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

1. GitHub repository with at least 10 test cases for one of factorial, Fibonacci or FizzBuzz function.
2. GitHub repository with at least 20 test cases for OOP assignment.


**Objectives**
----------

## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |
| * Definition of Test Driven Development | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Pros and Cons of using the TDD approach to developing applications |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| * Steps involved in the TDD process - Add a Test, Run Tests, Write the Code (to make the tests pass), Run Tests, Refactor Code, Repeat | [ ] |    [ ] |

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am creating new functionality **Action:** I define my test before I write my code | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When building out any application using the TDD approach **Action:** I write tests, let them fail, before adding in code to make the tests pass. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When building an application **Action:** I make sure to get as close as possible to 100% test coverage. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When writing test cases **Action:** I identify all the possible edge cases and write my tests to take care of these cases | [ ] |    [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| TDD can help me attain 100% test coverage | [ ] | [ ] |
| Writing tests reduces the risk of my program malfunctioning in the future | [ ] | [ ] |
| Writing tests help me better define the specifications of an application I am building | [ ] | [ ] |
| My application will be considered more stable if I have solid test coverage | [ ] | [ ] |
| Following TDD practice will make me a better programmer | [ ] | [ ] |
