# Outcome 5 - Test-Driven Development

**Skill Description**
----------
Outcome - By the end of Phase B - Bootcamp, aspiring Andelans should be about 30% of the way to client readiness with Test-Driven Development. This know what tests are, how to write them and how the TDD approach can be beneficial in development.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will be able to create the following:

1. At least 10 test cases for one of Factorial, Fibonacci or FizzBuzz function.
2. At least 20 test cases for OOP assignment.


**Objectives**
----------

## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |
| * Definition of Test Driven Development. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Pros and Cons of using the TDD approach to developing applications |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| * Steps involved in the TDD process - Add a Test, Run Tests, Refactor (until all tests have passed) - Write some more code, Run Tests. | [ ] |    [ ] |

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am creating new functionality **Action:** I define my test before I define my function. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When writing test cases **Action:** I identify all the possible edge cases and write my tests to take care of these cases. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When building out any application **Action:**  I write tests, let them fail, before adding in code to make the tests pass. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When building an application **Action:** I make sure to get as close as possible to 100% test coverage. | [ ] |    [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| My program can have 100% test coverage. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Writing tests reduces the risk of my program malfunctioning in the future. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Writing tests help me better define the specs of an application Iâ€™m building. | [ ] | [ ] |
| My application will be considered more stable if I have solid test coverage. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Following TDD practice will make me a better programmer. | [ ] | [ ] |
