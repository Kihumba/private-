# Outcome 1 - Version Control

**Skill Description**
----------
By the end of Phase B - Bootcamp, aspiring Andelans should be about 30% of the way to client readiness with version control. This means they can build and manage personal and shared repos using conventional git workflows and Github.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. A blog post on what the HEAD is and how it’s important
2. A personal repo with commits
3. A shared repo with commits, conflicts and at least one merge


**Objectives**
----------

## **Behaviors**


### Git Workflow
| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |

| **Context:** When I am about to continue work on an ongoing project... **Action:** I pull in changes from the remote repository. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** After I update my codebase with working code... **Action:** I make a commit. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** After every commit... **Action:** I push the changes to Github. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When making a commit... **Action:** I include a commit message that describes exactly what I did and that will be interpretable by another developer. | [ ] |    [ ] |
