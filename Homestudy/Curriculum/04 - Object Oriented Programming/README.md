# Outcome 4 - Object Oriented Programming

**Skill Description**
----------
Aspiring Andelans understand what object oriented programming is, when and how to apply this paradigm when modeling problems. They understand general OOP concepts and how OOP is implemented in Python. They understand how to create classes with properties and methods and take advantage of OOP to keep their code DRY. They know and can identify when OOP is overused or badly-designed. They are also able to do independent research on the possibilities and applications of OOP and can explain findings to other learners.



**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create:

1. A screenshot of a score of 80% or higher in the object oriented programming module on Proctor.

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When fellow learners approach me with basic questions on object oriented programming | | |
| - **Action:** I share my understanding of the concept with them in a way that they understand | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context** When thinking about a solution to a programming problem | | |
| - **Action** I identify if using OOP would be ideal | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context** When using OOP to solve a programming problem is ideal  | | |
| - **Action** I identify the objects and figure out the attributes and behaviors of that object in my mind | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context** When I come across a program that was implemented using OOP | | |
| - **Action** I look through the codebase to see if I understand how the concepts I know were used | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action** I look through the codebase to see how the principles of DRY code were applied | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action** I do a little research on the concepts applied to gain better understanding of those that I am aware of and those that I am unaware of | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context** When I see OOP overused or badly-designed in a codebase | | |
| - **Action** I identify the areas for improvement and communicate appropriately| [ ] | [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I have a clear picture of a programming problem when I model using OOP| [ ] | [ ]  |
| An application's codebase is more sustainable and reusable when OOP is used | [ ] | [ ]  |
