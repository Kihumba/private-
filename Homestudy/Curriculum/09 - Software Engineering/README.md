# Outcome 9 - Software Engineering

**Skill Description**
----------
Aspiring Andelans adopt a software development cycle (SDLC) model while developing a software. They understand several SLDC models and phases.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will have:

1. A score of 80% or higher in the software engineering module on Proctor.


**Objectives**
----------


## **Knowledge**

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |
||||
| Software engineering | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The role of a software engineer | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The two branches of software engineering | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Software paradigms  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Characteristics of a good software  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Software development life cycle | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Waterfall model  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Agile model   | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Iterative model  | [ ] | [ ] |
| Spiral model  | [ ] | [ ] |
| Big bang model  | [ ] | [ ] |
| The most commonly used SDLC model  | [ ] | [ ] |

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When working on software development team|||
| **Action:** I recommend using a SDLC model to the team before development | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When given a software to develop|||
| **Action:** I identify the SDLC model that best suits the team and project | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Action:** I identify the roles of a software engineer for the project |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Action:** I involve a software engineer in the development process | [ ] | [ ] |



----------


## **Beliefs**

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| There is no SDLC without a software engineer and vice versa | [ ] | [ ]  |
| A good software is built with a software engineer and an SDLC model being part of the process | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Software development process is easier with a software engineer involved in the process | [ ] | [ ]  |
