# Outcome 5 - Data Structures

**Skill Description**
----------
Aspiring Andelans understand what it means to organize and store data for efficient search and retrieval. They know the common primitive and abstract data structures and how to make use of the appropriate data structure to represent data.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will have:

1. A score of 80% or higher in the data structures module on Proctor.
