# Outcome 2 - The Android UI

## Skill Description
The users of your application will interact with the application through the user interfaces (UI). Android provides a collection of `View` and `ViewGroup` objects that offer you common input controls (such as buttons and text fields) and various layout models (such as a linear or relative layout).

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create an Android app that looks like the Gmail app (only the Interface).

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When designing the UI of any Android app **Action:** I take advantage of the different layouts available and edit the XML generated to suit my app's purpose.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:**  When adding components to my Android app **Action:** I make use of the styles.xml sheet available for me in the resources directory (res) to style the components. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When organising the resources used on my Android app **Action:** I keep all resources such as images, drawables, layouts, strings etc. in the provided resources directory (res) and reference them through the R class. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When my app needs to provide feedback to users **Action:** I use the Android dialogs, Toasts, or snackbar. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When adding components to my Android app **Action:**  I ensure that I capture the event for that component and ensure that it will be useful to the users. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Any programmer can understand my app if my resource folder is well organised. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Components are only useful when I write code for the events they listen for. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| An Android application built with careful attention to UI will enable and inspire users. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| The User Interface of an Android app is essential for more than "looking pretty." It is the doorway to access the functionality of my application. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
