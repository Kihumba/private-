### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When designing the UI of any android app ... **Action:** I take advantage of the different layouts available and edit the XML generated to suit the app's purpose.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:**  When adding components to my android app and need to style the components ... **Action:** I make use of the styles.xml sheet available for me in the resources directory (res) |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When organising the resources used on my android app ... **Action:** I keep all resources such as images, drawables, layouts, strings etc. in the provided resources directory (res). I do not use them directly on my application but reference them through the R class.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When my app needs to provide feedback to users ... **Action:** I use the Android dialogs or Toasts or snackbar |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When adding components to my android app... **Action:**  I ensure that I capture the event for that component. I will not add any component that is not useful to the users. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
