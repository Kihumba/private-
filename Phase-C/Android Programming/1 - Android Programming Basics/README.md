# Outcome 1 - Android Programming Basics

## Skill Description
Android provides a rich application framework that allows you to build innovative apps and games for mobile devices in a Java language environment. It is important that you understand the basics of the Android OS and how to set up your work environment to get started with Android programming.

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to do the following:
- Install the Java JDK and set up the JRE
- Install the Android Studio and connect the JDK to the Android Studio
- Install the Genymotion emulator
- Write a basic android app to compute celsius to fahrenheit
- Run the app on an emulator.
- Run the app on an actual android device.
