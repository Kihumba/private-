# Outcome 8- Testing your Android Application

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can write both Unit and Instrumentation tests for their Android application. They can explain what needs to be tested in an Android application, and why test driven development is such a powerful best-practice. 

### Output
- **Task:** Take an Android application that you have been working on (or a new application) and work through a debugging exercise. Back up and refactor the application, this time building in unit tests through TDD as you go. 
- **Resources:** Use JUnit to write all necessary unit tests and Espresso for instrumentation testing (or be able to explain why you chose another tool) 
- **Include:** N/A

- **Alternative Task:** Test an activity, a service, and a content provider (combine both instrumentation testing and unit testing, use an appropriate testing tool of your choice)

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Practiced |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:**  When I am building my Android app's main logic **Action:** I employ the TDD approach where I write the tests first. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I am creating an Android app **Action:** I build in unit tests. |   [ ]   |   [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I want to start writing and running my Android tests **Action:** I set up my test development environment first. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When measuring code coverage for testing my application, **Action:** I aim for 60-70% coverage. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to verify that my code returns the right results, **Action:** I run state testing. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to verify that my code calls certain methods properly, **Action:** I run interaction testing. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am testing a UI where the rendering details are abstracted away from the UI logic, **Action:** I use interaction testing. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to test user actions on my Android app **Action:** I test both on the emulator and on multiple different Android devices (if possible). | [ ] | [ ]  |
