Outcome 7- Writing Multithreaded Applications

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can use multithreading to allow their application to run multiple tasks at once. They can explain the concept of multithreading, identify when itâ€™s being used, and outline what is happening in the background of concurrent events. 

## Output
- **Task:** Create a application that allows the user to select as many files as they want to download at the same time. 
- **Resources:** Use multithreading to handle which ones download first, how to deal with a failed download, and how to allow concurrent actions on the application while the downloads execute. 
- **Include:** N/A

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Practiced |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to make concurrency possible in my application, **Action:** I use multithreading. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When multiple threads need to access the same resource, **Action:** I use synchronized blocks. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to reduce idle time and maximize my CPU, **Action:** I create a multithreaded environment. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am building multithreading into my application, **Action:** I consider whether there is a library that can help me do my work more effectively. | [ ] | [ ]  |
