# Outcome 7 - Sensors and Location Services

## Skill Description
The Android devices have a nice collection of sensors which enrich the user experience. These sensors measure motion, orientation, and various environmental conditions. An addition skill covered in this outcome is the location services - Android gives your applications access to the location services supported by the device through classes in the `android.location`.

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:
  -An Android app that uses sensors to integrate at least one environmental condition into the user interaction.
