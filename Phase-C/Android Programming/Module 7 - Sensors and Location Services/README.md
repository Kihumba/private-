# Module 7: Sensors and Location Services - KBBs
**Summary:**

The Android devices have a nice collection of sensors which enrich the user experience. We will cover the basics of these sensors so that the student is aware of their existence and capabilities.

The learning outcomes expected of a fellow that has covered this module are as follows:
- Demonstrated understanding of what sensors including motion and position sensors.
- Understanding of best practices when using sensors.
- How to use location services.


The following are the Knowledge, Behaviors, and Beliefs for Sensors and Location Services.
