# Outcome 4 - Testing Android Apps

## Skill Description
The fellow is able to write good tests capable of catching bugs early in a typical app development. The fellow is also able set up the test development environment and configure projects for instrumentation testing, and is able write apps using the BDD and TDD approach. 

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

A notetaking app using behaviour driven development as defined in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QXkEb8KrZczAtPQAmin50nfDqju584mgSk30J8yQFnc/edit">Android checkpoint #3</a>
