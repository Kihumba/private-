# Outcome 4 - Testing Android Apps

## Skill Description
Well-written tests can help you catch bugs early in your android app development. Thus, writing and running tests as part of your Android app development is highly important. Before you start writing and running your tests, you must set up your test development environment. You also need to learn to configure your project for instrumentation testing.

## Output
After attaining this skill, together with skills from outcomes 1 to 3, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following app:

**Note Taker**

**_Problem Description_**

In this exercise you will be required to create a note taking Android app using Behavior driven development.

**_Task 0 - Design a mockup for the app_**

Create the application mockup with invisionapp(<a href="http://www.invisionapp.com">invisionapp.com</a>), sketch(Mac) or any mockup software of choice

**_Task 1 - Build Note Taker Interface_**
Create an application interface that will allow the user to create, list, edit and delete notes (following the mockup from task 0)

**_Task 2 - Code all the features of the application_**

The application should have the following features:
- Create a new note
- List notes
- Edit note
- Save note
- Auto-save note
- Move note to trash
- Restore note from trash
- Empty notes in trash
- Share note by email
- Application settings

**_Task 3 - Auto-saving Notes._**

Users should be able to set time for auto saving current notes (in the application settings)

**_Task 4 - Write TDD and BDD(Instrument) Test for the App_**

Using any instrumentation test of choice (Solo or Espresso is recommended), write a BDD Test as well as TDD for the application
