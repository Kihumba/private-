# Outcome 4 - Testing Android Apps

## Skill Description
Well-written tests can help you catch bugs early in your Android app development. The Fellow will be able to set up a test environment, configure their project for testing, and write and run effective tests for their Android app. 

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create an interactive Android application using behavior driven development and an appropriate BDD test (Solo or Espresso recommended).
