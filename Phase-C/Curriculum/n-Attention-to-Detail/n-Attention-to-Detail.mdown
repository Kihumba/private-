# Outcome n - Attention to Detail


## Skill Description

The Fellow understands the importance of reviewing outputs (code committed, emails sent, slack messages, development environment setup, UI's created) to ensure it meets standards. Through their output, they consistently demonstrate this skill. The fellow understand the importance of carefully reviewing requests and ensuring that they address everything that is being requested. They pay attention to the context of the problem (see whole picture), and are able to create thorough solutions that address the entire issue and any corresponding issues (eg. fixes all instances of a code review comment and not just the specific example pointed out to them) 


## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:
