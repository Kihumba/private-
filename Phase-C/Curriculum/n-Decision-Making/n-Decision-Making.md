# Outcome n - Decision Making


## Skill Description

The Fellow displays an objective, balanced approach toward decision making. Includes data gathering, identifying multiple options, weighing pros and cons of each option, and using the analysis to inform the ultimate decision.  Prioritizes objectives based upon their level of severity and importance. Is able to determine this on their own.


## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

1. Written proposal recommending a course of action for my team that describes research, data, and the pros and cons of various alternatives compared to team and organizational priorities.

### Behaviors


| Observable Behavior | Observed | Mastered |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| | | |
| **Context:** When tasked with making a decision or recommendation | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I explicitly define the problem I am trying to solve and/or the desired outcomes for the given decision, requesting input from stakeholders if it affects their work or requires their insight/expertise. | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I review personal, team, and organizational goals and priorities as they relate to the decision at hand by recalling my knowledge, reviewing relevant tools and docs, and inquiring with stakeholders. | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I explicitly define, in writing, a comprehensive range of alternative actions I or the team could take. | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I conduct research and gather data on the issue at hand and proposed alternative courses of action (see *When conducting research*... below) | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I analyze the associated pros and cons of each alternative. Support these pros and cons by referencing research and data and comparing the alternatives to personal, team, and organizational priorities. | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I select a recommended course of action | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I summarize the research, data, alternatives with associated pros and cons, and recommended course of action and communicate all of that information concisely to stakeholders | [ ] | [ ] |
| | | |
| **Context:** When conducting research and gathering data on alternatives | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I determine the amount of time I have to offer the recommendations or make the decision | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I decide the appropriate scope and depth of research to conduct and data to gather given the relative priority of the decision and the amount of time I have for making the recommendendation / decision | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I explicitly identify assumptions I have about the decision at hand. | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I conduct balanced and unbiased research that aims to gather the information required to make a prudent decision supported by data, rather than seeking evidence to support prior-held beliefs and preferences that are not supported by data. | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I explicitly define the problem I am trying to solve and desired outcomes. Define research questions, desired data points, and data collection methods given the problem / desired outcomes and the amount of time I have to conduct research. Focus on the most impactful (relative to goals and priorities) and realistic (relative to timeframe) research and data collection methods. | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I vet all sources of information for bias, authenticity, relevance, and accuracy. Utilize a variety of sources to gain a balanced and broad perspective on the issue. Clearly identify the sources of information used for researching the decision. | [ ] | [ ] |
| | | |
| **Context:** When identifying alternatives | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I think creatively and out-of-the box to identify alternatives that may not be immediately present. | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I consider the "do-nothing" option and ask, "what are the associated pros and cons if we do not act or preserve the status quo?" | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I explicitly identify the associated pros and cons of each alternative, including what resources would need to be implement the alternative and where those resources might draw from. Base these pros and cons primarily on the specific goals and priorities of the team and organization. | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I identify a broad and complete range of alternatives while thinking through and researching the decision. | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I refine into a easily-digestible handful of alternatives (2 to 6) when presenting to stakeholders. | [ ] | [ ] |
| | | |
| **Context:** When making a final recommendation | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I clearly and concisely summarize the desired outcomes, research and data collection methods and findings, possible alterantives, pros and cons of these alternatives, and the final recommendation to stakeholders. | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I am transparent about the drawbacks of the recommended course of action. | [ ] | [ ] |
