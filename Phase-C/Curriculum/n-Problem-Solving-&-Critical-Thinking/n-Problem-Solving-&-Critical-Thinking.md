#Outcome n - Problem Solving & Critical Thinking


## Skill Description
The Fellow is able to use generic (when available) or ad hoc methods (when not available) in an orderly manner to find solutions to problems. The Problem Solving process consists of a sequence of sections that fit together depending on the type of problem to be solved. These are:

  - Problem Definition. 
  - Problem Analysis. 
  - Generating possible Solutions. 
  - Analyzing the Solutions. 
  - Selecting the best Solution(s). 
  - Planning the next course of action (Next Steps)


## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:
