# Outcome n - Holistic & Big Picture Thinking


## Skill Description

The Fellow is able to understand the big picture of how their work impacts their client, the application they are working on and the end user of the product.   They incorporate their understanding to ask questions to better flesh out the feature and ensure that the changes they make address all these factors rather than strictly implementing a request as specified.


## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

1. Written or recorded description of how my work affects the organizations I am a part of, the application(s) I am building, and the users of the application.
2. A list of questions I have asked that helped me better flesh out a feature I was building to meet the big picture needs of my organization, application, and/or users.
