# Outcome 2 - Functions

Skill Description
------
A function is a block of code that contains procedures that perform an operation(s) and might return a value. Functions are used to house a collection of procedures that are required to run from top to bottom.

Outputs
-------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. A program in Swift Playground that can parse different data types, and return a result


## Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| What are functions?| [ ] | [ ] |
| What are Arguments and Parameters? | [ ] | [ ] |
| How can you make an Argument Optional? | [ ] | [ ] |
| How do you pass Functions as Arguments to Functions? (Callbacks in Swift) | [ ] | [ ] |
| What are the Function shorthands in Swift | [ ] | [ ] |


## Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to run  a collection of procedures that should run from top to bottom **Action:** I will make use of functions when I need to run. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making use of callback functions that contain Parameters that I need to work with directly, **Action:** I use the shorthands available and avoid creating variables or references to the Parameters | [ ] | [ ] |

## Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that making use  of functions when I need to run procedures will run them from top to bottom without any interruptions. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that working directly with Parameters of functions, not creating redundant variables or references improves the performance of my application by saving memory | [ ] | [ ] |
