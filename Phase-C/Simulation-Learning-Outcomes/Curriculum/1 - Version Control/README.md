# Outcome 1 - Version Control(GIT)

Skill Description
----------
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
This module targets GIT, it's usage and purpose in building software.


Output
----------

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. Consistent and Team complaint commits to the Simulation project and Checkpoint repositories.

## Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When creating a project that I intend to revisit **Action:** I create a new remote repository on Github and pull down to my local repository. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am about to continue work on an ongoing project **Action:** I pull in changes from the remote repository. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After I update my codebase with working code **Action:** I commit the changes. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After every major commit **Action:** I push the changes to the remote repo. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making a commit **Action:** I include a commit message that describes exactly what I did and that will be interpretable by another developer, following the format specified by my Team. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I think about writing new code **Action:** I think about whether or not I need a branch. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Whenever I’m setting up Git on a new machine **Action:** I ensure I setup my SSH keys. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I’m working in a team **Action:** I need to identify the git workflow pertinent to the team and adopt it. | [ ] | [ ] |

## Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that branching creates a safe space to try new things when I’m implementing a new feature. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe using Git for my personal project is very valuable for tracking my progress. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that understanding a particular git workflow could make working in teams relatively easy. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe I can identify the different git work flows, and select the flow that bests suits my team or adopt the already existing flow | [ ] | [ ] |
