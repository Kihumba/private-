# Outcome 18 - Debugging

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands the basics of debugging including being able to replicate the problem, and gradually breaking down the process into simpler components to isolate the root cause of the defect.

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able create do the following:

1. A log of bugs I have fixed on a project and how I fixed them
