## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before I implement software requirements **Action:** I write tests that specifically describe the software requirements | [ ] | [ ] |
| | | |
| **Context:** When I write tests **Action:** I write tests for edge cases and unexpected inputs | [ ] | [ ] |
| | | |
<<<<<<< HEAD
| **Context:** After writing failing tests that describe the problem I'm trying to solve **Action:** I write the actual programming solution to make the tests pass | [ ] | [ ] |

| To write effective tests, I must clearly understand the feature's specification and requirements | [ ] | [ ] |
| Test-driven development is a gateway to writing modularized, flexible, and extensible code | [ ] | [ ] |
| Programmers that write more tests are more productive | [ ] | [ ] |
| Test-driven development eliminates my subconscious tendency to write tests that I know will pass | [ ] | [ ] |
| Testing for edge cases and unexpected inputs makes my code more robust and rock solid | [ ] | [ ] |
