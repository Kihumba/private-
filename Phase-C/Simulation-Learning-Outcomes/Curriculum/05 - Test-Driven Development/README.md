| **Context:** Before I implement software requirements **Action:** I write tests that specifically describe the software requirements | [ ] | [ ] |
| | | |
| **Context:** When I write tests **Action:** I write tests for edge cases and unexpected inputs | [ ] | [ ] |
| | | |
| **Context:** After writing failing tests that describe the problem I'm trying to solve **Action:** I write the programming solution to make the tests pass | [ ] | [ ] |
