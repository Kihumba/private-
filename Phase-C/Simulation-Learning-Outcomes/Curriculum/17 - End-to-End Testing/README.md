# Outcome 17 - End-to-End Testing

**Skill Description**
----------
<<<<<<< HEAD
The Fellow understands the importance of end-to-end testing. The Fellow can apply end-to-end testing to test system dependencies and ensure data integrity across an application.

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

1. A project with robust end-to-end tests
=======
The Fellow understands the importance of end-to-end testing and can demonstrate the same by writing an end-to-end test scenario and script which identifies system dependencies and ensures data integrity across a sample application.
