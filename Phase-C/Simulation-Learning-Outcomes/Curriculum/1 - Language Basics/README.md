# Outcome 1 - Language Basics

Skill Description
----------
Swift is a modern Object Oriented Programming language similar to Java and Javascript.
Swift provides its own versions of all fundamental C and Objective-C types, including Int for integers, Double and Float for floating-point values, Bool for Boolean values, and String for textual data. Swift also provides powerful versions of the three primary collection types, Array, Set, and Dictionary.
This outcome focuses on:
 - Constants & Variables
 - Control Flow Statements


Output
----------
1. A program in Swift Playground that uses variables and constants.
2. A Playground Project that processes an input and produces a conditioned output.
3. A Swift Playground Project that processes a collection of data. It should perform the same operation for each item in the collection.

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. Consistent and Team complaint commits to the Simulation project and Checkpoint repositories.

| _Variables and Constants_ |
| What is a variable? | [ ] | [ ] |
| What is a constant? | [ ] | [ ] |
| A constant as an immutable variable | [ ] | [ ] |
| How do you create Variables and Constant? How to use `var` and `let` respectively.| [ ] | [ ] |
| _Control Flow Statements_ |
| What are Control Flow Statements?| [ ] | [ ] |
| What are the types of Control Flow Statements? | [ ] | [ ] |
| What are Conditionals? | [ ] | [ ] |
| What are the type of Conditionals? (if-else, switch-case, do-catch) | [ ] | [ ] |
| What are loops? | [ ] | [ ] |
| What are the types of Loops? (for, for-in, while) | [ ] | [ ] |  


## Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| _Variables and Constants_ |
| **Context:** When I want to program with a dynamic value, **Action:** I use a variable. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to program with a static value, **Action:** I use a constant. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When defining variables or constants, **Action:** I use names that are descriptive of what the variables or constants contain. | [ ] | [ ] |
| _Control Flow Statements_ |
| **Context:** When I have procedures to run, that depend on a certain input or value, **Action:** I use a conditional expression to cater for the optional procedure to run. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have a collection of data to process, **Action:** I use a procedure inside the loop to repeat the operation for each item in the collection. | [ ] | [ ] |

## Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| _Variables and Constants_ |
| I believe that using variable and constants appropriately will make my programs more efficient and readable. | [ ] | [ ] |
| _Control Flow Statements_ |
| I believe that using Loops when I need to repeat a procedure for a number of items in a collection will keep my code [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that using conditional statements to express optional procedures based off an input or value will affect the output of a process. | [ ] | [ ] |
