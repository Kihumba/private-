# Outcome 4 - Data Structures

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands the basic concepts of data structures, the most common data structures (linear data structures and hash tables), and  how to identify the most efficient structure to use in a given situation.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

1. Screenshots of passed HackerRank exercises on lists, stacks, queues, and hash tables as suggested by Success Department
