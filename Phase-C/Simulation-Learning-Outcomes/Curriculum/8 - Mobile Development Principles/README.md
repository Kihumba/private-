# Mobile Development Principles - KBBs
**Summary:** The following are the Knowledge, Behaviors, and Beliefs for Mobile Development Principles.

----------
## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| _Evolution of mobile application development_ | | |
    <ul><li>What different mobile platforms (iOS, Android, Blackberry, Mobile Web) exist?</li></ul> | [ ] | [ ] |
    <ul><li>How do you classify mobile devices (hardware) and by their manufacturers (HTC, Samsung, Apple, Motorola, Nexus, Innjoo)</li></ul> |[ ] | [ ] |
    <ul><li>Leveraging on features available on mobile phones such as wifi, camera, accelerometers, gyroscopes etc.</li></ul> | [ ] | [ ]  |
| <ul><li>UI/UX for Mobile: How to Manage the User Interface/management of space of small screens?</li></ul> | [ ] |  [ ] |
| _Mobile apps as front-end_ | | |
<ul><li>For applications that have back-end APIs, how do we build a mobile app as front-end for the backend just as much as other front-ends such as web or desktop might or could exist in this case of ubiquitous computing? There is therefore need to understand how to consume services in order to build mobile apps as front-ends.</li></ul>| [ ] |    [ ] |
| _Managing Orientation Changes_ | | |
<ul><li>How does your app respond when user rotates screen? Do you rearrange the components to fit into or adapt to the orientation change?</li></ul> | [ ] |    [ ] |
| _Security of Mobile applications_ | | |
<ul><li>Depending on the mobile platform you are building for, the question of security arises all the time and you could take advantage of the features already available on the mobile device such as fingerprint, pattern recognition etc. Security is more than passwords, it has a lot more to do with encryption, hashing, pattern matching and recognition.</li></ul> | [ ] | [ ] |
| Understand responsiveness (especially for Mobile web) | [ ] |    [ ] |
| Navigation Models peculiar to the platform the app runs on (Android, iOS, Blackberry etc.) | [ ] | [ ] |
| How do you Provide feedback? (Alerts, Toasts, Snackbar etc.) | [ ] |    [ ] |

## **Behaviors**


### Git Workflow
| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When building mobile web applications.. **Action:** I usually test for responsiveness by checking how it looks on different screen dimensions (example tablets, mobile phones) | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When building mobile apps... **Action:** I usually leverage of the available features of mobile apps such as camera, wifi, bluetooth, accelerometers etc. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When working on mobile applications... **Action:** I can manage the small screen space by carefully placing controls, managing the space available. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
