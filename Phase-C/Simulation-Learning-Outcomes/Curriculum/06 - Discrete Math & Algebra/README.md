# Outcome 6 - Discrete Math & Algebra

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands the concepts of discrete math focused on understanding what probability is and on basic algebra (assignment and use of variables) 

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to complete the following sections of Khan Academy's Probability snd Statistics course:

1. Independent and Dependent events
2. Probablity and Combinatorics
