# Outcome 6 - Discrete Math & Algebra

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands the concepts of discrete math focused on probability and basic algebra (assignment and use of variables) 

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

1. Screenshots showing I passed the exercises in following sections of Khan Academy's Probability snd Statistics courses:
  - Independent and Dependent events
  - Probablity and Combinatorics
2. A program showing assignment and use of variables
