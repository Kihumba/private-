# Version Control (GIT) - KBBs

## Knowledge
1. What is Version Control?
2. Possible use cases of Version Control
3. Other example version control systems apart from Git
4. Github, Bitbucket as a web based repository hosting services
5. The commands needed in a Git workflow (pull, push, branch, commit, merge, status, rebase, cherry-pick)
6. What are the necessary steps to be taken in order to fix merge conflicts?
7. What are the different Git Workflows?
	- Centralized Workflow
	- Feature Branch Workflow
 	- Gitflow Workflow
 	- Forking Workflow
8. What determines the Git Flow to use in your team?
9. Describe how git hooks can be employed in deploy processes.


## Behaviors
1. Should know what a Git workflow looks like
	- When creating a project that I intend to revisit, I create a new remote repository on Github and pull down to my local repository.
 	- When I am about to continue work on an ongoing project, I pull in changes from the remote repository.
	- After I update my codebase with working code, I make a commit.
	- After every commit, I push the changes to Github.
	- When making a commit I include a commit message that describes exactly what I did and that will be interpretable by another developer.
	- When I think about writing new code, I think about whether or not I need a branch.
2. Whenever I’m setting up Git on a new machine I ensure I setup my SSH keys.
3. When I’m working in a team, I need to identify the git workflow pertinent to the team and adopt it.
4. I’ll take advantage of git (client-side & server-side) hooks for automation and deployment processes.


## Beliefs
1. I believe that branching creates a safe space to try new things when I’m implementing a new feature.
2. I believe using Git for my personal project is very valuable for tracking my progress.
3. I believe that understanding a particular git workflow could make working in teams relatively easy.
