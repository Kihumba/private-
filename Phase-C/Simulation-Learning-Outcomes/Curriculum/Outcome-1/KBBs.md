## Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Should know what a Git workflow looks like | [ ] | [ ] |
| When creating a project that I intend to revisit, I create a new remote repository on Github and pull down to my local repository. | [ ] | [ ] |
| When I am about to continue work on an ongoing project, I pull in changes from the remote repository. | [ ] | [ ] |
| After I update my codebase with working code, I make a commit. | [ ] | [ ] |
| After every commit, I push the changes to Github. | [ ] | [ ] |
| When making a commit I include a commit message that describes exactly what I did and that will be interpretable by another developer. | [ ] | [ ] |
| When I think about writing new code, I think about whether or not I need a branch. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Whenever I’m setting up Git on a new machine I ensure I setup my SSH keys. | [ ] | [ ] |
| When I’m working in a team, I need to identify the git workflow pertinent to the team and adopt it. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I’ll take advantage of git (client-side & server-side) hooks for automation and deployment processes. | [ ] | [ ] |


## Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that branching creates a safe space to try new things when I’m implementing a new feature. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe using Git for my personal project is very valuable for tracking my progress. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that understanding a particular git workflow could make working in teams relatively easy. | [ ] | [ ] |
