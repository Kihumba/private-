# Outcome 14 - API

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands the basics of application programming interfaces including requests, responses and authentication.  They will demonstrate knowledge of being able to use at least one common API.

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to do the following:

1. A project using a common external API
