# Outcome 14 - API

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands the basics of application programming interfaces including requests, responses and authentication.  They are able to use at least one common API.

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

1. A project using a common external API

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I use make requests to an API that requires authentication **Action:** I authenticate my request | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I build front-end applications that make requests to APIs **Action:** I implement a dynamic front-end that displays information based on the responses from the API server | [ ] | [ ] |
