| What is Javascript? Understand Javascript as a language for the web. | [ ] | [ ] |
| How is Javascript written? The Basic syntax governing Javascript (Targeting ES5) | [ ] | [ ] |
| ***Javascript syntax and concepts for:*** | [ ] | [ ] |
|	**Variables and Constants** |	[ ] | [ ] |
|	**Control Flow Methods** | [ ] | [ ] |
|		*Conditionals*
|		- If / else

|		*Looping*
|			-	for
|			- for\-in
|			- while
|			- do\-while
|	**Functions and Callbacks** | [ ] | [ ] |
|		- Declaring functions
|		- Closures as self calling functions
|	**Data types** | [ ] | [ ] |
|			*Primitive*
|			-	Numbers
|			-	Strings
|			-	Booleans
|			-	Undefined (typeof undefined)
|			-	Null (typeof object)
|			-	Symbols (ES6)
|			*Non-primitive*
|			-	Objects
|	**Prototype Oriented Programming** (_This is the O.O.P of Javascript_) | [ ] | [ ] |
|		-	Creating Classes and prototyping | [ ] | [ ] |
|		-	Adding properties and methods to a class | [ ] | [ ] |
|		-	Class instances as Objects. | [ ] | [ ] |
|		-	Extending already existing classes using `.prototype`  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Data Structures in Javascript** | [ ] | [ ] |
| *Stacks, Queues and other data structures in other languages can be custom built in Javascript, but don’t exist by default. Listed are the defaults:* |
|	-	Object literals (using Objects)	| [ ] | [ ] |
|	-	Arrays	| [ ] | [ ] |
| ***Using Javascript libraries in your full stack application.*** | [ ] | [ ] |
|		**Adding the libraries to your application**	| [ ] | [ ] |
|		-	On the Frontend, the SCRIPT tag in HEAD tag of  the DOM.
|		-	Server side scripts are imported or required into the scripts that depend on such libraries
|		**Installing Javascript libraries** | [ ] | [ ] |
|		-	What are package managers? | [ ] | [ ] |
|		-	What package manager is used in your stack for Javascript? | [ ]	| [ ] |
|		**List of common package managers** | [ ]	| [ ] |
|			- npm for Node.js | [ ] | [ ] |
|			- bower, Universal, used with PHP, Python, Node.js etc | [ ] | [ ] |
|			- RoR uses the gem file for managing all its dependencies both ruby and javascript. | [ ] | [ ] |
|		**Common libraries in Javascript** | [ ] | [ ] |
|			-	JQuery | [ ] | [ ] |
|			-	Bootstrap | [ ] | [ ] |
|			-	Materialize | [ ] | [ ] |
|			-	Angular | [ ] | [ ] |
| ***Javascript as an asynchronous language*** | [ ] | [ ] |
|		-	How are callbacks used? |	[	] | [ ] |
|		-	Why are non-blocking processes necessary in Javascript. |	[	] | [ ] |
| ***What is a minified script*?** | [ ] | [ ] |
|		-	What are the advantages of using Minified scripts (cutting overhead) |	[	] | [ ] |


## Behaviors

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| When I need to write Javascript, i will write neat, conformal Javascript syntax, with comments, following the recommended style guides and keeping my code DRY in the process. | [ ] | [ ] |
| When I need to loop in Javascript, I will use the most appropriate Loop control flow (e.g for-in for objects, for for Arrays) to iterate through the collection. | [ ] | [ ] |
| When I need to encapsulate variables or control the scope of variables, I will place them in functions / closures where there are required. | [ ] | [ ] |
| When I need to create a reusable service or function, I will make use of a well defined class (literal function) having the prototypes and / or properties (as variables or methods) pertinent to it’s usage. | [ ] | [ ] |
| When I need to extend the functionality of an existing class I will create a prototype method, extending the already existing class, and implementing my custom method, to simplify the  method’s reference when I need to use it. | [ ] | [ ] |
| When I need to import a Javascript library to my project, I will use the minified scripts to avoid the overhead that might come with the library (long variable names, comments, and  whitespace). | [ ] | [ ] |
| When I need to import Javascript libraries into my full stack application, I will make use of the most appropriate package manager recommended for the stack I’m working with, for a seamless integration and application deployment. | [ ] | [ ] |
| When I make function calls that are asynchronous, I will make use of callback functions that process the results when these resource becomes available. | [ ] | [ ] |


## Beliefs

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe I can write DRY and well commented javascript, while adhering to the style guides, keeping my code base legible and easy to understand. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that I will use the most appropriate control flow for conditions and loops based on the values to be compared and the type of collection to be iterated, respectively. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe I can create a class when I need a reusable resource, to avoid repetition. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe I can add functionality to an already existing class using Prototyping. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe I can isolate the scope of my variables for better security when I write sensitive methods that should be not edited in real-time. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe I can use external Javascript libraries in my full stack project handled by package managers akin to the full stack technology. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe I can take advantage of Javascript’s asynchronous nature by using callbacks to process resources in the background without distorting the user’s experience. | [ ] | [ ] |
