## Behaviors

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| When I need to write Javascript, i will write neat, conformal Javascript syntax, with comments, following the recommended style guides and keeping my code DRY in the process. | [ ] | [ ] |
| When I need to loop in Javascript, I will use the most appropriate Loop control flow (e.g for-in for objects, for for Arrays) to iterate through the collection. | [ ] | [ ] |
| When I need to encapsulate variables or control the scope of variables, I will place them in functions / closures where there are required. | [ ] | [ ] |
| When I need to create a reusable service or function, I will make use of a well defined class (literal function) having the prototypes and / or properties (as variables or methods) pertinent to it’s usage. | [ ] | [ ] |
| When I need to extend the functionality of an existing class I will create a prototype method, extending the already existing class, and implementing my custom method, to simplify the  method’s reference when I need to use it. | [ ] | [ ] |
| When I need to import a Javascript library to my project, I will use the minified scripts to avoid the overhead that might come with the library (long variable names, comments, and  whitespace). | [ ] | [ ] |
| When I need to import Javascript libraries into my full stack application, I will make use of the most appropriate package manager recommended for the stack I’m working with, for a seamless integration and application deployment. | [ ] | [ ] |
| When I make function calls that are asynchronous, I will make use of callback functions that process the results when these resource becomes available. | [ ] | [ ] |


## Beliefs

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe I can write DRY and well commented javascript, while adhering to the style guides, keeping my code base legible and easy to understand. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that I will use the most appropriate control flow for conditions and loops based on the values to be compared and the type of collection to be iterated, respectively. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe I can create a class when I need a reusable resource, to avoid repetition. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe I can add functionality to an already existing class using Prototyping. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe I can isolate the scope of my variables for better security when I write sensitive methods that should be not edited in real-time. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe I can use external Javascript libraries in my full stack project handled by package managers akin to the full stack technology. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe I can take advantage of Javascript’s asynchronous nature by using callbacks to process resources in the background without distorting the user’s experience. | [ ] | [ ] |
