# Javascript

###Outcome
Javascript is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that. It was invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.
JavaScript itself is fairly compact but very flexible, and developers have written a lot of tools that sit on top of the core JavaScript language to unlock a huge amount of extra functionality with very little effort.
