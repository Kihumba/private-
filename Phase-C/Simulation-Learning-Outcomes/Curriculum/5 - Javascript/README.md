# Outcome 1 - Javascript

Skill Description
----------
Javascript is a full-fledged dynamic programming language. It was invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.
JavaScript itself is fairly compact but very flexible, and developers have written a lot of tools that sit on top of the core JavaScript language to unlock a huge amount of extra functionality with very little effort.

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

## Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** After I've written some Javascript code, **Action:**  I refine it to make sure it's DRY, well commented and follows the adopted style guide. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to create a loop in Javascript, **Action:** I use the most appropriate Loop control flow (e.g for-in for objects, for for Arrays) to iterate through collections. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When encapsulating variables or controlling its scope in Javascript, **Action:** I place them in the functions and / or closures were they are required. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to create a reusable service or method, **Action:** I make use of a well defined classes (literal function) having the prototypes and / or properties (as variables or methods) pertinent to it’s usage. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to extend the functionality of an existing class in Javascript, **Action:** I create a prototype method, extending the already existing class, and implementing my custom method, to simplify the  method’s reference when I need to use it. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I import a Javascript library to my project, **Action:** I use the minified scripts available to avoid the overhead that might come with the library (long variable names, comments, and  whitespace). | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I import Javascript libraries into a full stack Javascript application, **Action:** I make use of the most appropriate package manager recommended for the stack I’m working with, for a seamless integration and application deployment. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I make function calls that are asynchronous, **Action:** I make use of callback functions that process the results when these resource becomes available. | [ ] | [ ] |


## Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that writing DRY and well commented javascript, while adhering to the style guides, will keep my code base legible and easy to understand. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that using the most appropriate control flow for conditions and loops based on the values to be compared and the type of collection to be iterated, will make my program run efficiently. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that using classes to create reusable resources will keep my code base DRY, and easier to manage. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that Prototyping allows me extend already existing classes, easily. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that isolating the scope of my variables for better security and memory management when I write sensitive methods will prevent it from being edited in real-time, and optimize memory, respectively. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that using Javascript libraries in my full stack project handled by package managers akin to the full stack technology, makes it easier to manage the library version whilst simplifying deployment. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that taking advantage of Javascript’s asynchronous nature, using callbacks to process resources in the background will prevent chronological methods from distorting the user’s experience. | [ ] | [ ] |
