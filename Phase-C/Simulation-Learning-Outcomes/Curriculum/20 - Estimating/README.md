# Outcome 20 - Estimating

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow is able to systematically break down work into individual tasks and provide estimates on each to ultimately derive an estimate on the LOE/time required to complete the work.  They should also be able to defend how they came up with the estimate. (Estimates at this stage are not expected to be 100% accurate)

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

1. A log of task estimates and the actual time it took to complete the tasks

## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |
| How to break down work into individual tasks | [ ] | [ ]  |
| How to estimate the Level of Effort/time it will take to complete individual tasks | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before I begin assigned work **Action:** I break down the work into smaller individual tasks | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After breaking down the work into smaller individual tasks **Action:** I estimate the LOE/time it will take to complete those tasks | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After estimating the LOE for the tasks **Action:** I communicate the estimates with relevant stakeholders while providing justifications for the estimates | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After the tasks have been completed **Action:** I compare the actual LOE to the estimated LOE to re-calibrate my mental estimation algorithm | [ ] | [ ] |
