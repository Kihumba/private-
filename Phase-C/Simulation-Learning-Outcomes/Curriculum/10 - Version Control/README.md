# Outcome 10 - Version Control

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands the concepts behind version control including why it is necessary and the value of branching and merging, and rollback.  The Fellow is able to resolve merge conflicts for their own code. The fellow knows how to install git, checkout files, commit files, create a branch, merge, and send a pull request.

Output
----------

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create the following:

1. Commits and Pull Requests that mirror the Git workflow used on personal and team projects I work on

## Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When setting up Git on a new machine **Action:** I configure my local machine with Git SSH keys | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When creating a new software project **Action:** I set it up with version control | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I join a team **Action:** I identify and adopt the Git workflow established by the team | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I modify code to an existing project **Action:** I pull changes from the remote repository based on the project's established Git workflow | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I begin work on a new feature, bug or enhancement **Action:** I consider using a branch | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After I update my local repository with working code **Action:** I commit the changes based on the project's established Git workflow and commit conventions | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making a commit **Action:** I include a commit message that clearly and concisely describes exactly what I did while adhering to the commit conventions of the project | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After an atomic amount of changes have been made on my local repository  **Action:** I push the changes to the remote repo according to the project's established Git workflow | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After I've completed a feature, bug or enhancement, and pushed all the changes  **Action:** I make a pull request to the remote branch required by the project's estblished workflow | [ ] | [ ] |


## Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Version control lets me rollback to working versions of my code when mistakes have been made | [ ] | [ ] |
| Git workflows greatly enhance remote collaboration with other world-class developers  | [ ] | [ ] |
| I build trust with my team members by pushing frequent quality and working commits to our repository | [ ] | [ ] |
| Branches give me a safe space and the freedom to experiment when implementing a new feature | [ ] | [ ] |
