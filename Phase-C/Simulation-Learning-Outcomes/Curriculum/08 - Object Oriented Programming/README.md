# Outcome 8 - Object Oriented Programming

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands the basic concepts of object oriented programming including abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, methods, and overloading.

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

1. A program that implements abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, methods, and overloading


**Objectives**
----------
## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |
| The difference between methods and functions in OOP | [ ] | [ ]  |
| How to implement abstraction in OOP | [ ] | [ ]  |
| How to implement inheritance in OOP | [ ] | [ ]  |
| How to implement polymorphism in OOP | [ ] | [ ]  |
| How to implement methods in OOP | [ ] | [ ]  |
| How to implement overloading in OOP | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When writing object-oriented programs **Action:** I use abstraction to create classes | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When writing a class **Action:** I hide implementation details of class methods from other classes that may interact with the class | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When writing a class that contains all the properties of an existing class **Action:** I let the new class inherit the properties of the existing class | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have many public methods that perform the same operation but with different input data types **Action:** I use overloading to expose only one public method for all possible inputs  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have a class method that multiple subclasses could implement differently **Action:** I use polymorphism to create the superclass method  | [ ] | [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Object-oriented programming is a necessary fundamental for understanding how to build modular, reusable and extendable programs | [ ] | [ ] |
