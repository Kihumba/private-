# Outcome 6 - Software Engineering Methodology

**Skill Description**
----------
A Software Engineering Methodology is a framework that is used to structure, plan, and control the process of developing an information system.
This module targets the usage and purpose of various software engineering methodologies in building good software.

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a developer in simulations should be able to:

1. Develop a software project adopting an agile approach & implement with Scrum techniques.
