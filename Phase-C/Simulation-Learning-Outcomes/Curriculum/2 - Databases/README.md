# Outcome 2 - Databases
## Skill Description
A Fellow should able to set up new databases, and query existing databases based on project requirements

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create the following:

1. Projects where I set up and queried SQL and NoSQL databases

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When starting a new project with persistent storage requirements **Action:** I select a SQL or NoSQL database based on the structure of data to be stored | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need a complex query in a SQL Database **Action:** I create VIEWS that abstract the query's complexity | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** Before saving user input data **Action:** I filter it to prevent SQL injection | [ ] | [ ]  |
