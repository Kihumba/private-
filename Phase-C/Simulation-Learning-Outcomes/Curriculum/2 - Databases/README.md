# Outcome 2 - Databases
## Skill Description
A Fellow should able to select a Database based on the data storage requirements, as well as the structure for querying and storing data.

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create the following:

- A Screenshot of score (80% at minimum) from each section of SQLZoo.net Quiz
