# Outcome 11 - 2 & 3 Tier Architecture

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands the basics of 2 and 3 tier architecture, including the different architectural layers, their functions, and mechanisms.

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

1. Project using 2-tier architecture
2. Project using 3-tier architecture
