| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Well-written repositories help abstract models from the controller and act as a go between for these two things. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| If I need to change a pattern that occurs repeatedly throughout my app, implementing a repository pattern will allow me to change it once rather than having to slog through and change each instance. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| A well written repository provides a single and consistent interface for data manipulation and encourages separation of concerns. | [ ] | [ ]  |
