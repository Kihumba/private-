# Outcome - Testing in Laravel

Skill Description
----------
Testing is a component of Extreme Programming (XP). We basically have Unit and Functional/Integrated tests.
With integration testing, we are able to verify that all components of our applications function as it is supposed to. Also, integration testing exposes problems with components of our application before it is exposed to the real world.
With Unit testing, you can test each individual component isolation.


Outputs
----------
In checkpoint 4:
- Write integration tests using Laravel's Inbuilt Integration test Suite In simulation project for all the features implemented.
