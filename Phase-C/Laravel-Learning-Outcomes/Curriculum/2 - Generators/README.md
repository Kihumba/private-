## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to scaffold login and registration, from model and migration to controller and
    views, along with a full test suite... **Action:** I use the "php artisan make:auth" command | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to stub out a model... **Action:** I use the "php artisan make:model" command | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to stub out a new controller... **Action:** I use the "php artisan make:controller" command | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to create a database migration class... **Action:** I use the "php artisan make:migration" command | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to stub out a new test class... **Action:** I use the "php artisan make:test" command | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to stub out a new command... **Action:** I use the "php artisan make:console" command | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When stubbing out laravel application files... **Action:** I reduce rework by taking advantage of inbuilt generators. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When working on repetitive tasks... **Action:** I create custom generators if there are no inbuilt generators to handle the task. | [ ] | [ ]  |
