# Outcome - REST and WEB APIs

Skill Description
----------
REST is the underlying architectural principle of the web and APIs adhere to the principle of REST.

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When making a request to an API endpoint... **Action:** I specify the appropriate content type e.g json, xml, text,etc.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When building an API... **Action:**  I version the build to depict updates/upgrades to the API.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When building an API... **Action:**  I document the API using apiary or swagger.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When building an API... **Action:**  I use fractal to create a transformation layer between the model and the data output.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to share data from my application with other applications... **Action:** I create endpoints for my application that others can interact with.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to separate a user’s account from the authentication process... **Action:** I use token based authentication as the life of a token is not tied to the user’s account.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When building an API... **Action:** I make full use of restful resources. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I need Javascript client hosted on a different domain to access my API... **Action:** I enable CORS for those domains.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I need to implement token authentication for my API... **Action:** I use JWT.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When setting up token authentication with short lived tokens... **Action:** I use refresh token to re-generate tokens once they tokens expire.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When building APIs... **Action:** I enable rate limiting to prevent users/bots from issuing too many request per second/minute/hour to my API.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When building an API that returns json... **Action:** I follow json api specification.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I need my API to handle file downloads **Action:** I use the `response->download` method | [ ] | [ ]  |
