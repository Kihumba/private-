# Outcome 8 - Views

Skill Description
----------
The view is the simplest part of the MVC structure -- at the basic level, it's just a bunch of HTML boilerplate into which you insert the variables you've received from your controller and which will be sent to the browser. It is the actual "webpage."

Outputs
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to build an application that makes use of the Laravel view rendering shortcut, as well as view templates and partials.
