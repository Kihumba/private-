# Outcome - Forms and Helpers

Skill Description
----------
Forms are possibly the most complicated thing about learning web development. Not necessarily because the code itself is difficult, but because you usually want to build forms that accomplish so many different things at once.

Understanding how forms are created in HTML and then how Laravel offers you some helpers to make your life easier will go a long way.

Outputs
----------
In checkpoint 2 and simulation projects:
