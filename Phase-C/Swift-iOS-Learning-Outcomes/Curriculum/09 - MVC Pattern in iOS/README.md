# Outcome 9 - MVC Pattern in iOS
## Skill Description

The Fellow will be able to create an iOS Application using the MVC pattern, creating each content as a modular entity, and bringing them together to build the product.

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create the following:

1. A model highlighting fields that represent a user object, mapped to a persistent data store (`NSKeyedArchiver` or `CoreData`)
2. A `UIViewController` tied to its script and Scene
3. A **Checkpoint 3** project submission meeting all the required specifications
