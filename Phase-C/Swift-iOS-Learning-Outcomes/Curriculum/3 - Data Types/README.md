# Outcome 3 - Data Types

Skill Description
------
Data types are simply a representation of data in forms that best suite their value. Common types are Strings and Characters, Integers, Floats and Doubles, Booleans, and the collections, in this case Arrays.

Outputs
-------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. A Swift Playground Application that returns varying outputs based on an input data type. A function with optional arguments will be used. Its arguments will encompass all the common data types.


## Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| What are Data Types? | [ ] | [ ] |
| What are the types of Data available in Swift? | [ ] | [ ] |
| How are custom Data types created? `typealias` | [ ] | [ ] |
| How do you create a collection of Data? | [ ] | [ ] |
| What is Data type inference in Swift | [ ] | [ ] |
| What methods can be used to iterate through a collection of Data? | [ ] | [ ] |
| How do you define a variable / constant and assign it a data type at the same time | [ ] | [ ] |
| How do you convert one Data type to another? (Typecasting) | [ ] | [ ] |


## Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to create, reference or manipulate data, **Action:** I will use the most appropriate data type that best suites that data. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I create a custom data type, **Action:** I use `typealias` to to make it easy to reference. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to process a collection of Data, **Action:** I use the `.forEach` function when available, otherwise I use a normal loop. | [ ] | [ ] |
|  **Context:** When I create a variable / constant, **Action:** I explicitly set the Data type, to make it luculent to other people that might read the code, at the same time eliminating the comments that I might have needed to justify the variable or constant. | [ ] | [ ] |


## Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that identifying and using the Data type that best matches the value I need make my application run efficiently. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that specifying, explicitly, the Data type of a variable or constant, makes my code base easy to read. | [ ] | [ ] |
