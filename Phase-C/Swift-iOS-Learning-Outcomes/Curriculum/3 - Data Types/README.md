# Outcome 3 - Data types
## Skill Description

The Fellow will be able to identify and use the Data types available in Swift, as well as create collections of these data types.

## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create the following:

1. A Swift Playground Application that returns varying outputs based on an input data type. A function with optional arguments will be used. Its arguments will encompass all the common data types.
2. A **Checkpoint 1** project submission meeting all the required specifications.

## Objectives
### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | |
| The Data types available in Swift | [ ] | [ ] |
| Custom Data types using `typealias` | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to create a collection | [ ] | [ ] |
| Data type inference | [ ] | [ ] |
| Collection Iteration methods in Swift | [ ] | [ ] |
| Type casting | [ ] | [ ] |
| Optionals in Swift | [ ] | [ ] |
| Unwrapping variables in Swift | [ ] | [ ] |

-------

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to create, reference or manipulate data, **Action:** I use the most appropriate data type that best suites that data | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I create a custom data type, **Action:** I use `typealias` to to make it easy to reference | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to process a collection of Data, **Action:** I use the `.forEach` function when available, otherwise I use a normal loop | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I create a variable / constant, **Action:** I explicitly set the Data type, to make it luculent to other people that might read the code, at the same time eliminating the comments that I might have needed to justify the variable or constant | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I create a collection, **Action:**, I match the collection to a Data type | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When creating a variable that is allowed to have no value i.e. `nil`, **Action:** I use Optionals, which allows the variable exist as `nil` even after assigning it a value | [  ] | [ ] |

-------

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Explicitly specifying the Data type makes my code readable | [ ] | [ ] |
| Collections hold the same type of Data that I specify | [ ] | [ ] |
| Optionals will serve as a normal variable when I unwrap them | [ ] | [ ] |
