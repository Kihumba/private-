# Outcome 3 - Data Types
## Skill Description

Data types are simply a representation of data in forms that best suite their value. Common types are Strings and Characters, Integers, Floats and Doubles, Booleans, and the collections, in this case, Arrays.

## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

- A Swift Playground Application that returns varying outputs based on an input data type. A function with optional arguments will be used. Its arguments will encompass all the common data types.
- The function should print the data types of the arguments that were passed.

- **Detailed and Documented coverage of this skill can be shown by completing _Checkpoint 1_, available upon request.**

## Objectives
### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Data types available in Swift. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Custom Data types `typealias`. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Creating a collection of Data. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Data type inference. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Collection Iteration methods in Swift (`forEach`, `map`, `filter` etc). | [ ] | [ ] |
| Data type conversion and type casting. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Optionals in Swift. Variables that can be `nil`. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Getting the value of an Optional (Unwrapping Optionals). | [ ] | [ ] |

-------

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to create, reference or manipulate data, **Action:** I use the most appropriate data type that best suites that data. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I create a custom data type, **Action:** I use `typealias` to to make it easy to reference. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to process a collection of Data, **Action:** I use the `.forEach` function when available, otherwise I use a normal loop. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I create a variable / constant, **Action:** I explicitly set the Data type, to make it luculent to other people that might read the code, at the same time eliminating the comments that I might have needed to justify the variable or constant. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I create a collection, **Action:**, I match the collection to a Data type. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When creating a variable that is allowed to have no value i.e. `nil`, **Action:** I use Optionals, which allows the variable exist as `nil` even after assigning it a value. | [  ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Explicitly specifying the Data type makes my code readable. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Collections hold the same type of Data that I specify. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Optionals will serve as a normal variable when I unwrap them. | [ ] | [ ] |
