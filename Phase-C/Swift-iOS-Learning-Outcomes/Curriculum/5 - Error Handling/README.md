# Outcome 5 - Error Handling
## Skill Description

The Fellow will be able to handle errors in an iOS Application, identifying and catching these errors during development, to prevent the application from crashing at runtime.

## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create the following:

1. A Swift Playground project that handles errors generated from bad inputs into a function and performs a different operation to cater for the error thrown that allows for normal operation of the application.
2. A Swift Playground Program that throws a custom error when it receives and invalid input, without any form of error handling. The custom Error should be enumerated and catch as such.
3. A Swift Playground Program that catches any generic error as NSError, and outputs the error message.
4. A **Checkpoint 1** project submission meeting all the required specifications.


## Objectives
### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | |
| The properties of common error class in Swift `NSError` | [ ] | [ ] |
| Types of Error in Swift | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to handle errors in Swift | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to throw errors | [ ] | [ ] |

-------

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When throwing Errors that have steps or categories, **Action:** I create an enumerated `ErrorType` that throws different Errors in steps to increase flexibility in the Error Handling | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to catch an Error from an Abstracted method, **Action:** I catch the Error as an NSError type | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Applications can crash at runtime if errors are not handled | [ ] | [ ] |
