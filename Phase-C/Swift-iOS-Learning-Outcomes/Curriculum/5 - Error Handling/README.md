# Outcome 5 - Error Handling
Skill Description
-----
Error handling is the process of responding to and recovering from error conditions in your program. Swift provides support for throwing, catching, propagating, and manipulating recoverable errors at runtime.

Error handling is important as programming in its dynamism could have properties and attributes set and unset at runtime.
A common scenario could be reading or writing a file programmatically. The file, being independent of the program could not exist or even have restricted read/write permissions, etc. This cases need to be taken care of, and thatâ€™s were error handling comes in.

Outputs
-------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. A Swift Playground project that handles errors generated from bad inputs into a function and performs a different operation to cater for the error thrown that allows for normal operation of the application.

2. A Swift Playground Program that throws a custom error when it receives and invalid input, without any form of error handling. The custom Error should be enumerated and catch as such.

3. A Swift Playground Program that catches any generic error as NSError, and outputs the error message.
