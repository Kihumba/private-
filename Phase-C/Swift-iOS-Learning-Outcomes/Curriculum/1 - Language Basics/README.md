# Outcome 1 - Language Basics
## Skill Description

Swift is a modern Object Oriented Programming language similar to Java and Javascript.
Swift provides its own versions of all fundamental C and Objective-C types, including Int for integers, Double and Float for floating-point values, Bool for Boolean values, and String for textual data. Swift also provides powerful versions of the three primary collection types, Array, Set, and Dictionary.

This outcome targets:
 1. Variables and Constants
 2. Control Flow Statements

## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

- A program in Swift Playground that uses variables and constants.
- A Playground Project that processes an input and produces a conditioned output.
- A Swift Playground Project that processes a collection of data. It should perform the same operation for each item in the collection.

- **Detailed and Documented coverage of this skill can be shown by completing _Checkpoint 1_, available upon request.**

### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| _Variables and Constants_ |
| Variables, as a value reference. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Constants as immutable variables. | [ ] | [ ] |
| A constant as an immutable variable. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Syntax for creating Variables and Constants, using `var` and `let` respectively.| [ ] | [ ] |
| _Control Flow Statements_ |
| Types of Control Flow Statements. | [ ] | [ ] |
| The type of Conditionals (if-else, switch-case, do-catch). | [ ] | [ ] |

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| _Variables and Constants_ |
| **Context:** When I want to program with a dynamic value, **Action:** I use a variable. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to program with a static value, **Action:** I use a constant. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When defining variables or constants, **Action:** I use names that are descriptive of what the variables or constants contain. | [ ] | [ ] |
| _Control Flow Statements_ |
| **Context:** When I have procedures to run that depend on a certain input or value, **Action:** I use a conditional expression to cater for the optional procedure to run. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have a collection of data to process, **Action:** I use a procedure inside the loop to repeat the operation for each item in the collection. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Appropriate use of variables and constants will make my application run efficiently. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Conditional statements allow me condition an output based on a input. | [ ] | [ ] |
