# Outcome 15 - Application Distribution
## Skill Description

Application Distribution is the medium used to share your compiled application to the public.
iOS applications are hosted on the Apple App Store and are made available to the public or to a certain group of people (alpha/beta testers).

This skill covers:
1. Localization
2. Regional Distribution

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

- Create an iOS Application with Localization for English, French and German. Text will be rendered from the Storyboard views and programmatically based on device's localization.


### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The requirements for Application Distribution on App Store (Developer License). | [ ] | [ ] |
| What is the process of uploading an App to the Apple App Store? | [ ] | [ ] |
| Why is it important to have Beta testers of your application before the final release of the Application? | [ ] | [ ] |
| What is Localization? | [ ] | [ ] |
| Localization in iOS app development |
| 1. Localization string file (_Localizable.strings_ file) | [ ] | [ ] |
| 2. Storyboard Localization string file (_Main.strings_ file) | [ ] | [ ] |
| 3. Referencing localized strings programmatically (`NSLocalizedString(â€¦)`) | [ ] | [ ] |

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before I deploy my application, **Action:** I add Beta testers that can run the application on the local devices before releasing the app. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need my application Localized, **Action:** I create the pertinent Localization string files and add translations for _all_ the words used in the application, hardcoding nothing. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to reference a Localized string programmatically, **Action:** I use the _NSLocalizedString_ function parsing in the _key_ of the string, mapped to its value in the _Localizable.strings_ file. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After uploading my application to the Apple App Store, **Action:** I select the Regions (countries) I'd like the application to be available in, or Globally to make it available on all Stores. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that using Beta testers to test run a application before its final release, simulates the real life scenario of downloading the app, and gives a full test of the application's initialization on local devices. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that using Localization in my application makes it show the pertinent language on the different Locales that are supported by my application. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that Regionalizing my application allows me target and restrict my audience. | [ ] | [ ] |
