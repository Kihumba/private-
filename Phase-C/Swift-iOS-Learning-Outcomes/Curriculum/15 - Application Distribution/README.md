# Outcome 15 - Application Distribution

Skill Description
-----
Application Distribution is the medium used to share your complied application to the public.
Most applications are hosted on the Apple App Store and are made available to the public or to a certain group of people better testers.

This skill also covers
1. Localization
2. Regional Distribution
-------

Outputs
-----
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. Create an iOS Application with Localization for English, French and German. Text will be rendered from the Storyboard views and programmatically, so as to employ both Localization string files.

## Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before I deploy my application, **Action:** I add Beta testers that can run the application on the local devices before releasing a final version. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need my application Localized, **Action:** I create the pertinent Localization string files and add translations for _all_ the words used in the application, hardcoding none. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to reference a Localized string programmatically, **Action:** I use the _NSLocalizedString_ function parsing in the _key_ of the string, mapped to its value in the _Localizable.strings_ file. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After uploading my application to the Apple App Store, **Action:** I select the Regions (countries) I'd like the application to be available in, or Globally to make it available in all Stores. | [ ] | [ ] |

## Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that using Beta testers to test run a application before its final release, simulates the real life scenario of downloading the app, and gives a full test of the application's initialization in local devices. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that using Localization in my application makes it automatically get interpreted on devices with different Locales that are supported by your application. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that Regionalizing my application allows me target and restrict my audience. | [ ] | [ ] |
