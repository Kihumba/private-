# Outcome 15 - Application Distribution
## Skill Description

The Fellow will be able to develop applications that support multiple languages with a targeted audience after uploading to the Apple AppStore.

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create the following:

1. An iOS Application with Localization for English, French and German. Text will be rendered from the Storyboard views and change based on device's localization.
2. A **Checkpoint 4** project submission meeting all the required specifications.

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before I deploy my application, **Action:** I add Beta testers that can run the application on the local devices before releasing the app | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need my application localized, **Action:** I create the pertinent localization string files and add translations for _all_ strings displayed in the application | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to reference a string in an app with localization, **Action:** I use the _NSLocalizedString_ method and map to its value in the _Localizable.strings_ file | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After uploading my application to the Apple App Store, **Action:** I select regions (countries) that my localization supports | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Beta testers help me simulate a real life scenario of downloading and using my application before its final release | [ ] | [ ] |
| Localization gives me the power to distribute a single application with multiple language support | [ ] | [ ] |
| Regionalizing my application allows me target and restrict my audience | [ ] | [ ] |
