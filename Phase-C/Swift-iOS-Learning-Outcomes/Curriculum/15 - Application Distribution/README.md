# Outcome 15 - Application Distribution
## Skill Description

Application Distribution is the medium used to share your compiled application to the public.
iOS applications are hosted on the Apple App Store and are made available to the public or to a certain group of people (alpha/beta testers).

This skill covers:
1. Localization
2. Regional Distribution

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

- Create an iOS Application with Localization for English, French and German. Text will be rendered from the Storyboard views and change based on device's localization.

<!--There is nothing in this out about actually submitting the app, add which part of submission are required to be tested , i.e. "and then submit a deliver a testflight beta build-->

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before I deploy my application, **Action:** I add Beta testers that can run the application on the local devices before releasing the app. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need my application localized, **Action:** I create the pertinent localization string files and add translations for _all_ strings displayed in the application | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to reference a string in an app with localization, **Action:** I use the _NSLocalizedString_ function and map to its value in the _Localizable.strings_ file. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After uploading my application to the Apple App Store, **Action:** I select regions (countries) that my localization supports. | [ ] | [ ] |

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Using beta testers to test an application before its final release simulates the real life scenario of downloading a localized application. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that regionalizing my application with localization allows me to target, reach, and restrict my audience. | [ ] | [ ] |
