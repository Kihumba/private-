# Outcome 15 - Application Distribution
## Skill Description

The Fellow will be able to develop applications that support multiple languages with a targeted audience after uploading to the Apple AppStore.

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create the following:

1. An iOS Application with Localization for English, French and German with text rendered based on device's localization in both Storyboard Scenes and programmatically.
2. A **Checkpoint 4** project submission meeting all the required specifications.

### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |
| The requirements for Application Distribution on AppStore | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to upload an App to the Apple AppStore | [ ] | [ ] |
| Alpha and Beta Testing of your uploaded application | [ ] | [ ] |
| Localizing text to rendered programmatically | [ ] | [ ] |
| Localizing text in the Storyboard | [ ] | [ ] |
| Referencing localized strings programmatically | [ ] | [ ] |
| Assigning your live App to a Regional Store | [ ] | [ ] |

------

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before I deploy my application, **Action:** I add Beta testers that can run the application on the local devices before releasing the app | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need my application Localized, **Action:** I create the pertinent Localization string files and add translations for _all_ the words used in the application, hardcoding nothing | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to reference a Localized string programmatically, **Action:** I use the _NSLocalizedString_ function parsing in the _key_ of the string, mapped to its value in the _Localizable.strings_ file | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After uploading my application to the Apple AppStore, **Action:** I select the Regions (countries) I'd like the application to be available in, or Globally to make it available on all Stores | [ ] | [ ] |
------

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Beta testers help me simulate my application's initialization on an iOS device over-the-air | [ ] | [ ] |
| Localization gives me the power to distribute a single application with multiple language support | [ ] | [ ] |
| Regionalizing my application allows me target and restrict my audience | [ ] | [ ] |
