# Outcome 9 - MVC Pattern in iOS
## Skill Description

In iOS application design, the MVC Pattern is employed.
Your services are split into Models, Views and Controllers created independent of each other. The 3 are brought together to form the MVC Pattern that represents your applicationâ€™s structure, each serving their purpose, coming together to make an application useable.

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

- Create a model highlighting fields that represent a user object, mapped to a persistent data store (`NSKeyedArchiver` or `CoreData`).
- Create a `UIViewController` with its Script and UI Component (the container of the Scene in the Storyboard).

- **Detailed and Documented coverage of this skill can be shown by completing _Checkpoint 3_, available upon request.**
