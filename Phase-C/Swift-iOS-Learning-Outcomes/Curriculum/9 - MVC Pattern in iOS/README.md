# Outcome 9 - MVC Pattern in iOS
## Skill Description

In iOS application design, the MVC Pattern is employed.
Your services are split into Models, Views and Controllers created independent of each other. The 3 are brought together to form the MVC Pattern that represents your applicationâ€™s structure, each serving their purpose, coming together to make an application useable.

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

- Create a model highlighting fields that represent a user object, mapped to a persistent data store (`NSKeyedArchiver` or `CoreData`).
- Create a `UIViewController` with its Script and UI Component (the container of the Scene in the Storyboard).

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before I build a application, **Action:** I separate the application's components into a Model, a View, and a Controller. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** While building an application, **Action:** The logic and behavior of the application will be created in its Controllers. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I access or manipulate data, **Action:** I create a Model that assumes the structure of data I'd like to modify and carry out all other operations on. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** While styling an application, **Action:** I'll make all the adjustments of the UI Elements in its Views. | [ ] | [ ] |
