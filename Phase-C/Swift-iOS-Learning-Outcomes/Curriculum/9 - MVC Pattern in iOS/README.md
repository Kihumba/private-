# Outcome 9 - MVC Pattern in iOS
## Skill Description

The Fellow will be able to create an iOS Application using the MVC pattern, creating each content as a modular entity, and bringing them together to build the product.

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create the following:

1. Create a model highlighting fields that represent a user object, mapped to a persistent data store (`NSKeyedArchiver` or `CoreData`).
2. Create a `UIViewController` with its Script and UI Component (the container of the Scene in the Storyboard).
3. A **Checkpoint 3** project submission meeting all the required specifications.
