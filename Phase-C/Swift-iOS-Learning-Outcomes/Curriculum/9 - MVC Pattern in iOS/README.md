# Outcome 9 - MVC Pattern in iOS
## Skill Description

In iOS application design, the MVC Pattern is employed.
Your services are split into Models, Views and Controllers created independent of each other. The 3 are brought together to form the MVC Pattern that represents your applicationâ€™s structure, each serving their purpose, coming together to make an application useable.

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

- A model highlighting fields that represent a user object, mapped to a persistent data store (`NSKeyedArchiver` or `CoreData`).
- A `UIViewController` with its Script 
- A UI Component (the container of the Scene in the Storyboard).

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before I build an application whose primary use is to save, update, and/or display data, **Action:** I separate the application's components into a Model, a View, and a Controller. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** While building an MVC application, **Action:** I construct the logic and data handling of the application in Controllers. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When building an MVC application, **Action:** I create models to represent the data I'd like to modify and use. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** While constructing a GUI in an MVC application, **Action:** I place UI Elements in its Views. | [ ] | [ ] |
