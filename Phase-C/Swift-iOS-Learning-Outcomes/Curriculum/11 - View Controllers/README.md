# Outcome 11 - View Controllers
## Skill Description

The View Controller is the container in the Scene where all the UI Elements are placed, which include buttons, text, images and other interactive Elements.

## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

- An iOS project with a View Controller embedded in a Navigation Controller, that navigates 2 controllers deep (excluding the initial View Controller) by tapping buttons.


## Objectives
### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The `UIViewController` class in the UIKit [namespace](../4%20-%20Object%20Oriented%20Programming/). | [ ] | [ ] |
| The Elements present a View Controller (in the Scene's container)? | [ ] | [ ] |
| Switching between View Controllers non-programmatically(Segues) and programmatically. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Embedding View Controllers in Navigation and Tab Bar Controllers. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Other forms of the `UIViewController` (Page, Table, Collection etc). | [ ] | [ ] |
| View Controllers are abstractions of the `UIViewController` class, with some added Behaviors. | [ ] | [ ] |
| `TableViewController` and `CollectionViewController` should contain a monolith element(s) / template(s) that are repeated for a collection of data. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Linking your View Controller in a Scene to your custom View Controller Class (swift code file). | [ ] | [ ] |

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to split your View Controllers into tabs for easy navigation using the `UITabBar`, **Action:** I use the Tab Bar Controller | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to automate the to and fro navigation between View Controllers using a `UINavigationBar`, **Action:** I use the Navigation Controller. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need a page that should contain just a table, **Action:** I should make use of a Table View Controller. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need a collection of items in my app to fill a page, **Action:** the page should be created as a Collection View Controller. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to add code functionality to my View Controller Scene, **Action:** I create a script with a class that implements the View Controllers' class, and reference it in the Scene. | [ ] | [ ] |
