# Outcome 11 - View Controllers
## Skill Description

The View Controller is the container in the Scene where all the UI Elements are placed, which include buttons, text, images and other interactive Elements.

## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

- An iOS project with a View Controller embedded in a Navigation Controller, that navigates 2 controllers deep (excluding the initial View Controller) by tapping buttons.

<!--This doesn't make sense, are you asking to navigate a nested view controller two levels in?
Might be better:An iOS project with a Navigation Controller, that navigates between 3 view controllers by tapping buttons.
-->

| In what circumstances do you embed view controllers in Navigation and Tab Bar Controllers? | [ ] | [ ] |

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to split View Controllers into tabs for easy navigation, **Action:** I use the Tab Bar Controller and it's associated classes. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to navigate between two or more view controllers **Action:** I use the Navigation Controller and it's associated classes. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to display a list of items of similar type **Action:** I use a Table View Controller and it's associated classes | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to display a list of items of varying type and layout **Action:** I use a Collection View Controller and it's associated classes | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to add custom code functionality to my view controller Scene, **Action:** I implement an appropriate view controllers class and reference it in the Scene. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that the various View Controllers are abstractions of the `UIViewController` class, with some added Behaviors. | [ ] | [ ] |
<!--This should be knowledge, not a belief-->
| I believe that one should reuse and recycles views to make my UI responsive and efficient | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that the Navigation Controllers, Tab View Controllers, and Page View Controllers are used to simplify creation of GUI. | [ ] | [ ] |
