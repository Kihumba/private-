# Outcome 11 - View Controllers
## Skill Description

The Fellow will be able use View Controllers with it's varying implementations to create Lists, Collections or just simple scenes with UI Views as well as passing data to View Controllers before they appear on the screen and scripting the behavior of the Controllers.

## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create the following:

1. An iOS project with a View Controller embedded in a Navigation Controller, that navigates between 3 view controllers by tapping buttons.
2. A **Checkpoint 4** project submission meeting all the required specifications.

## Objectives
### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The `UIViewController` class in the UIKit [namespace](../4%20-%20Object%20Oriented%20Programming/) | [ ] | [ ] |
| The Elements that can be added to the View Controller Scene | [ ] | [ ] |
| Switching between Scenes programmatically | [ ] | [ ] |
| Passing properties to View Controllers before they load | [ ] | [ ] |
| Embedding View Controllers in Navigation and Tab Bar Controllers | [ ] | [ ] |
| Other implementations of the `UIViewController` | [ ] | [ ] |
| View Controllers used to present list or collections | [ ] | [ ] |

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to split the View Controllers into tabs for easy navigation using the `UITabBar`, **Action:** I use the Tab Bar Controller and it's associated classes | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to navigate between two or more View Controllers, **Action:** I use the Navigation Controller and it's associated classes | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to display a list of items of similar type, **Action:** I should make use of a Table View Controller and it's associated classes | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to pass data to a View Controller,  **Action:** I override the `prepareForSegue` function and assign the data accordingly | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to display a list of items of varying type and layout, **Action:** I use a Collection View Controller and it's associated classes | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to add custom code functionality to my View Controller Scene, **Action:** I implement an appropriate View Controller class and reference it in the Scene. | [ ] | [ ] |
