# Outcome 6 - Testing
## Skill Description

The Fellow will be able to write Unit and UI Tests. The Fellow will understand and implement T.D.D when developing iOS Applications.

## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create the following:

1. An iOS project with failing tests cases intended to cover the functions defined.
2. An iOS Project with passing tests targeting the methods and properties of a defined Class.
3. A **Checkpoint 1** project submission meeting all the required specifications.

## Objectives
### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The benefits of Test Drive Development | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to write a Unit test | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to write UI Tests | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to test asynchronous operations | [ ] | [ ] |
| The test Assertions available in Swift | [ ] | [ ] |

-------

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to assert the proper functioning of an application, **Action:** I write tests to compare the output of the methods with their ideal outputs | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** While writing tests, **Action:** I use assertions to create the expectations for my methods and procedures | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to build an application using tests, **Action:**  I begin with tests, making the methods abstracted, testable and scalable as independent units (modular) | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before writing a test, **Action:** I select the assertion that most matches the expectation of the method or value to be tested | [ ] | [ ] |

-------

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The potential of bugs are reduced when I write tests | [ ] | [ ] |
| The Test Driven Development approach forces me to write modular code that can be easily maintained and trusted | [ ] | [ ] |
