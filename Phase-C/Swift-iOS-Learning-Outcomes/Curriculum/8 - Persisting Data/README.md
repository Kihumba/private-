# Outcome 8 - Persisting Data
## Skill Description

In real life applications, data is received and sent over-the-air (OTA) following the CRUD pattern (Create, Read, Update and Delete). More often than none, data will need to be accessed offline, data that might affect the way requests are made to the server or data thats written and read frequently. This Skill covers the methods available in iOS that can be used to persist data on a mobile device.

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

- An iOS Project is to be created which includes CoreData in the project initialization. The Project will write and read Sample Data into all 3 storage systems, User Defaults, NSKeyedArchiver and CoreData.

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I have data to store locally on a device, **Action:** I will the most appropriate persistent Data stores based on the data format. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to save relational data, **Action:** I use CoreData. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I use NSKeyedArchiver, **Action:** I serialize the data manually. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to save non-relational data, **Action:** I can use NSKeyedArchiver or the User Defaults. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When saving key-value data or data that is relatively small, **Action:** I make use of User Defaults. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that data should be saved on the device when its to read / written frequently. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that User Defaults is used to save text data only Ã‚when quick access to said data is required. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that CoreData can be used to save relational data on a local device. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that CoreData runs on SQLite Engine in the background. | [ ] | [ ] |
