# Outcome 8 - Persisting Data
## Skill Description

The fellow will be able to store data locally on an iOS device where necessary, using the most appropriate storage system based on the type of data to be persisted.

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create the following:

1. An iOS Project is to be created which includes `CoreData` in the project initialization. The Project will write and read Sample Data into all 3 storage systems, User Defaults (`NSUserDefaults`), `NSKeyedArchiver` and `CoreData`.

2. A **Checkpoint 2** project submission meeting all the required specifications.

## Objectives
### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |
| The importance of Persisting Data | [ ] | [ ] |
| The use cases for un-persistent data | [ ] | [ ] |
| The storage systems used for persisting data in iOS | [ ] | [ ] |
| The types of data stored with each system | [ ] | [ ] |
| The query methods used in each system | [ ] | [ ] |
| The data storage limits of each API | [ ] | [ ] |

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I have data to store locally on a device, **Action:** I use the most appropriate storage system based on the data format | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to save relational data, **Action:** I use `CoreData` | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I use `NSKeyedArchiver`, **Action:** I serialize the data manually | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to save non-relational data, **Action:** I can use `NSKeyedArchiver` or the User Defaults (`NSUserDefaults`) | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When saving key-value data or data that is relatively small , **Action:** I make use of User Defaults (`NSUserDefaults`) | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Data is saved on the device when its to read or written frequently | [ ] | [ ] |
| User Defaults (`NSUserDefaults`) gives me the ability to store lite data for quick access | [ ] | [ ] |
| `CoreData` runs on SQLite Engine and will allow me store relational data | [ ] | [ ] |
