# Outcome 4 - Object Oriented Programming

Skill Description
------
OOP (Object Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm where everything is treated as objects, as compared to the real world. The essential properties of OOP are: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation.


Outputs
-------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. In the Swift Playground, create a class that implements / extends the NSObject class.

2. By default the Playground included the Foundation namespace. Remove the Foundation namespace, take note of what happens. Create a comment under the Foundation import with your note.

3. Extend the `String` class, and add a function that returns an Array of words in a sentence.

## Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that understanding the essentials of Object Oriented Programming will allow me write well decoupled and reusable code. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that using Computed Properties will improve my code quality by abstracting property operations. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that namespaces help make importing and referencing of packages and methods more explicit | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that `protocol` and `extensions` make Inheritance, Abstraction and other concepts of O.O.P, easy to implement in Swift. | [ ] | [ ] |
