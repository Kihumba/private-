# Outcome 4 - Object Oriented Programming
## Skill Description

OOP (Object Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm where everything is treated as objects, as compared to the real world. The essential properties of OOP are: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation.


## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

- In the Swift Playground, create a class that implements / extends the NSObject class.
- By default, the Playground includes the Foundation namespace. Remove the Foundation namespace, take note of what happens. Create a comment under the Foundation import with your note.
- Extend the `String` class, and add a function that returns an Array of words in a sentence.

- **Detailed and Documented coverage of this skill can be shown by completing _Checkpoint 1_, available upon request.**

## Objectives
### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Namespace referencing in Swift. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Similarities and Differences between Structs and Classes. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Use cases for Classes and Structs. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Using Enumerations with Conditionals. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Using Computed Properties (Getters and Setters) in Classes. | [ ] | [ ] |
| The advantages of using Computed Properties as opposed to manually calling methods. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Syntax for creating Getters and Setters. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Protocol Oriented Programming using `protocol` and `extension`. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Adding methods to existing Classes using `extension`. | [ ] | [ ] |

-------

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want a collection of methods, properties or attributes that I need to re-use, **Action:** I create a Class that contains these methods and attributes, and create instances of that Class when I needed. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to create a Class that that needs some existing behaviors already present in another Class, **Action:** I will create a Class that inherits these behaviors. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to access classes, function and variables, **Action:**  I will import the encapsulating namespace and reference them accordingly. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to encapsulate a few relatively simple data values, **Action:** I make use of Structs. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to extend the functionality of an existing Class, to add methods or properties, **Action:** I use the `extension` concept. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The essentials of object oriented programming helps me write well decoupled and reusable code. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Inheritance and Abstraction will prevent me from writing duplicate blocks of code, [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). | [ ] | [ ] |
| Computed Properties will improve my code quality by abstracting property procedures. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Namespaces gives me the ability to explicitly reference a particular package. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Protocols and Extension helps me implement Inheritance and Abstraction in O.O.P. | [ ] | [ ] |
