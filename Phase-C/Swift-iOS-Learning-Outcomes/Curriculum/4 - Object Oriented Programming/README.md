# Outcome 4 - Object Oriented Programming
## Skill Description

OOP (Object Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm where everything is treated as objects, as compared to the real world. The essential properties of OOP are: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation.


## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

- In the Swift Playground, create a class that implements / extends the NSObject class.

<!-- - By default, the Playground includes the Foundation namespace. Remove the Foundation namespace, take note of what happens. Create a comment under the Foundation import with your note. 

This is too instructional, needs to be removed from the LO. -->

- Extend the `String` class, and add a function that returns an Array of words in a sentence.

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want a collection of methods, properties or attributes that I need to re-use, **Action:** I create a Class that contains these methods and attributes, and create instances of that Class when I need to. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to create a Class that that needs some existing behaviors already present in another Class, **Action:** I create a Class that inherits these behaviors. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to access classes, functions, and variables, **Action:**  I import the encapsulating namespace and reference them accordingly. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to encapsulate a few relatively simple data values, **Action:** I make use of Structs instead of classes. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to extend the functionality of an existing Class, **Action:** I use the `extension` keyword to add methods or properties. | [ ] | [ ] |

<!-- Behavior for when to use a protocol vs. inheritence needed here... | **Context:** When I need to pass down inheritable behaviors and characteristics, **Action:** I  | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Writing decoupled and reusable code makes it easier to maintain and improve my codebase. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Knowing the essentials of object oriented programming will allow me to write decoupled and reusable code. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Using the concept of Inheritance and Abstraction will prevent me from writing duplicate blocks of code, [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). | [ ] | [ ] |
| Using Computed Properties will improve my code readability. | [ ] | [ ] |
| `protocol` and `extension` make Inheritance, Abstraction and other concepts of O.O.P easy to implement in Swift. | [ ] | [ ] |
