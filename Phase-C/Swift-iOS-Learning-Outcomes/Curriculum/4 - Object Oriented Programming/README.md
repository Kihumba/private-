# Outcome 4 - Object Oriented Programming

## Skill Description

OOP (Object Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm where everything is treated as objects, as compared to the real world. The essential properties of OOP are: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation.


## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

- In the Swift Playground, create a class that implements / extends the NSObject class.
- By default the Playground included the Foundation namespace. Remove the Foundation namespace, take note of what happens. Create a comment under the Foundation import with your note.
- Extend the `String` class, and add a function that returns an Array of words in a sentence.

## Objectives
### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| What is O.O.P? | [ ] | [ ] |

| What are Classes? And how are they similar to Structs? | [ ] | [ ] |
| What are Enumerations and how are they used? | [ ] | [ ] |
| _Computed Properties_ |
| What are Computed Properties? (Getters and Setters) | [ ] | [ ] |

| How and where are Computed Properties created? | [ ] | [ ] |
| _Protocol Oriented Programing_ | [ ] | [ ] |
| What is P.O.P? (`protocol`) | [ ] | [ ] |
| How can I extend the functionality of an already existing class? (`extension`) | [ ] | [ ] |

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want a collection of methods, properties or attributes that I need to re-use, **Action:** I  create a Class that contains this methods and attributes, and create instances of that Class when I need to. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to create a Class that that needs some existing behaviors already present in another Class, **Action:** I will create a Class that inherits these behaviors. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to access classes, function and variables, **Action:**  I will import the encapsulating namespace and reference them accordingly. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to encapsulate a few relatively simple data values, **Action:** I make use of Structs. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to extend the functionality of an existing Class, to add methods or properties, **Action:** I use the `extension` concept. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that knowing the essentials of object oriented programming will allow me write well decoupled and reusable code. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe using the concept of Inheritance and Abstraction will prevent me from writing duplicate blocks of code, [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that I can identify the uses cases of Structs and Classes and use the one more pertinent to the use case. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that using Computed Properties will improve my code quality by abstracting property operations. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that namespaces help make importing and referencing of packages and methods more explicit | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that creating inheritable behaviors and characteristics that I need to transcend down a Class or Struct by achieved easily in Swift using Protocols. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that extending already existing classes and adding custom functionality to them for my perusal by achieved easily in Swift by making use of Extensions. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that `protocol` and `extensions` make Inheritance, Abstraction and other concepts of O.O.P, easy to implement in Swift. | [ ] | [ ] |
