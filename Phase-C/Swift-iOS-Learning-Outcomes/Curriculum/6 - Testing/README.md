# Outcome 6 - Testing
## Skill Description

Testing is a method of assessing the functionality of a software program. This consists of assertions, that compare the application's real outputs with its ideal or expected outputs. Swift comes with an inbuilt testing framework called `XCTest`. To use it in your application, you have to import the namespace to your application, using the `import` keyword. This skill consists of:

- Writing a basic Unit Test
- Running tests
- Testing Assertions

## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

- An iOS project with custom Test cases setup. These tests will contain Passing and Failing assertions.
- An iOS project with failing tests cases intended to cover the functions defined.
- An iOS Project with passing tests to cover the defined functions.

### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| What is a unit test? | [ ] | [ ] |

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to assert the proper functioning of an application, **Action:** I write tests to compare the output of the methods with their ideal outputs. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** While writing tests, **Action:** I use assertions to create the expectations for my methods and procedures. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to build an application, **Action:**  I begin with tests, making the methods abstracted, testable and scalable as independent units (modular). | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before writing a test, **Action:** I select the assertion that most matches the expectation of the method or value to be tested. | [ ] | [ ] |

-------

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that writings tests at the early stage of an application helps reduce the potential of bugs. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that the test-driven development approach, will enable me write modular code that can be easily maintained and tested. | [ ] | [ ] |
