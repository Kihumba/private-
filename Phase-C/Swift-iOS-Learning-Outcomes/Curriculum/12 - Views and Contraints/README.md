# Outcome 12 - Views and  Constraints
## Skill Description

A person with this skill can create responsive Scenes in iOS, with UI View Elements tied with Constraints, responding to Actions and Outlets to be used by the View Controller.

## Output

Create an iOS Project with UI Elements on its View Controller (linked to its Outlets and Actions), with Constraints on the UI Elements that help them maintain their positions across the following Apple device screen sizes:
 - iPhone 3.5"
 - iPhone 4.7"
 - iPhone 5.5"
 - iPad 9.7"
 - iPad 12.9"

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I add views to my View Controller, **Action:** I choose an appropriate UI element that suits the purpose| [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I add views to my Controller, **Action:** I link them as Outlets or Actions based on the purpose they serve | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to position UI Elements in my View Controller, **Action:** I will use Constraints to make sure they adapt to various screen sizes | [ ] | [ ] |
