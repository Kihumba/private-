# Outcome 12 - Views and  Constraints
## Skill Description

The Fellow will be able to create responsive Scenes, with UI View Elements tied with Constraints, responding to Actions and Outlets to be used by the View Controller.

## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. An iOS Project with UI Elements on its View Controller linked to their Outlets and Actions as required with Constraints on the UI Elements that help them maintain their positions across all Apple mobile devices (3.5” - 5.5”).
2. A **Checkpoint 4** project submission meeting all the required specifications.

## Objectives
### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |
| `UIView` as the base class for all UI Elements | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to add `UIViews` to a Scene's View Controller | [ ] | [ ] |
| All UI Elements as abstractions of the UIView class | [ ] | [ ] |
| The common UI View Elements | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to use `IBOutlet` and `IBAction` | [ ] | [ ] |
| Restricting a `UIView` to a position on the screen | [ ] | [ ] |
| Setting Constraints programmatically | [ ] | [ ] |

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I add UI View Elements to my View Controller, **Action:** I add the Element that best suits the purpose | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I add Elements to my Controller, **Action:** I link them as Outlets or Actions based on the purpose they serve | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to position UI Elements in my View Controller, **Action:** I will use Constraints to make sure they are not misplaced on various screen sizes | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| UI View Elements are the object users interact with when they use my application | [ ] | [ ] |
| Views can respond to input when I assign them an `IBAction` | [ ] | [ ] |
| Constraints on my UI Elements will make them display properly on all screens | [ ] | [ ] |
