# Outcome 12 - Views and  Constraints

Skill Description
-----
The _Views_ are the UI Elements you add to your app. All the UI Elements in iOS are implementations of the `UIView` class, which contain all the basic UI properties like _size_, _backgroundColor_, _alpha_ etc.

_Constraints_ are rules that bind the Views to the positions they occupy on the Screen of the mobile device. The Constraints help arrange or lock the elements, so there are no glitches when the app is deployed on various devices with different screen sizes and orientations.

Outputs
-------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. Create an iOS Project, add UI Elements to its View Controller, each UI Element to linked to their Outlets and Actions as required.

2. Create an iOS project with a View Controller (with UI Elements) and a Controller. Add Constraints in the UI Elements so they have the same positions across all Apple mobile devices (3.5” - 5.5”).

## Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| _Views_ |
| What is a View? (Class `UIView`) | [ ] | [ ] |
| What parent container are `UIView` added to? | [ ] | [ ] |
| All UI Elements are abstractions from the UIView class. | [ ] | [ ] |
| The common Elements include `UIButton`, `UILabel`, `UITextView`, `UITextField`, `UIImageView` all inherit the properties of the `UIView` alongside their custom properties. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Each UIView has its specific purpose and Traits that depict what the represent e.g the `UIImageView` has the Image trait. | [ ] | [ ] |
| A `UIView` can be referenced as an Outlet (as a variable reference, `IBOutlet`) or as an Action (event triggered by the Element `IBAction`) based on their traits. | [ ] | [ ] |
| _Constraints_ |
| What are Constraints? | [ ] | [ ] |
| How do you add Constraints to your UI Elements? | [ ] | [ ] |
| Why do I need to add Constraints to my UI Elements? | [ ] | [ ] |

## Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I add Elements to my View Controller, **Action:** I add the correction Element that suits the  purpose.| [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I add Elements to my View Controller and Controller, **Action:** I link them as Outlets or Actions based on their traits and the purpose they serve. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to position UI Elements in my View Controller, **Action:** I will use constraints to make sure they are not misplaced on various screen sizes | [ ] | [ ] |

## Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that creating a View Controller with the appropriate UIView elements creates a seamless user experience. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that creating an Outlet (`IBOutlet`) for a `UIView` makes the `UIView` object available in my Controller's script. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that creating an Action (`IBAction`) for a `UIView` makes it possible to assign actions / events to a `UIView` and hand them in the Controller's script | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that If i add the pertinent Constraints to my UI Elements, they will display properly on all screens | [ ] | [ ] |
