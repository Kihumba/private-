# Outcome 12 - Views and  Constraints
## Skill Description

The _UIViews_ are the UI Elements you add to your app. All the UI Elements in iOS are implementations of the `UIView` class, which contain all the basic UI properties like _size_, _backgroundColor_, _alpha_ etc.

_Constraints_ are rules that bind the Views to the positions they occupy on the Screen of the mobile device. The Constraints help arrange or lock the elements, so there are no glitches when the app is deployed on various devices with different screen sizes and orientations.

## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

- Create an iOS Project, add UI Elements to its View Controller, each UI Element to linked to their Outlets and Actions as required.
- Add Constraints to the UI Elements so they maintain their positions across all Apple mobile devices (3.5” - 5.5”). 

<!--Dont say all, pick specific target sizes that have a good range. i.e. 
Apple iPhone 3.5" 
Apple iPhone 5.5" 
Apple IPad 2 9.7"
 -->

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I add views to my View Controller, **Action:** I choose an appropriate UI element that suits the purpose.| [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I add views to my Controller, **Action:** I link them as Outlets or Actions based on their traits and the purpose they serve. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to position UI Elements in my View Controller, **Action:** I will use constraints to make sure they adapt to various screen sizes. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Creating a view controller and using appropriate UIView elements enhances the user experience. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Using Outlets and Actions streamline the process of connecting visual elements to code. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Using constraints instead of hardcoding dimensions is an efficient way to address different display sizes | [ ] | [ ] |
