# Outcome 12 - Views and  Constraints
## Skill Description

The _UIViews_ are the UI Elements you add to your app. All the UI Elements in iOS are implementations of the `UIView` class, which contain all the basic UI properties like _size_, _backgroundColor_, _alpha_ etc.

_Constraints_ are rules that bind the Views to the positions they occupy on the Screen of the mobile device. The Constraints help arrange or lock the elements, so there are no glitches when the app is deployed on various devices with different screen sizes and orientations.

## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

- Create an iOS Project, add UI Elements to its View Controller, each UI Element to linked to their Outlets and Actions as required.
- Add Constraints to the UI Elements so they maintain their positions across all Apple mobile devices (3.5” - 5.5”).

## Objectives
### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| _Views_ |
| `UIView` as the base class for all UI Elements. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Adding `UIViews` to a Scene's container. | [ ] | [ ] |
| All UI Elements are abstractions from the UIView class. | [ ] | [ ] |
| The common Elements include `UIButton`, `UILabel`, `UITextView`, `UITextField`, `UIImageView` all inherit the properties of the `UIView` alongside their custom properties. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Each UIView has its specific purpose and Traits that depict what they represent e.g the `UIImageView` has the Image trait. | [ ] | [ ] |
| A `UIView` can be referenced as an Outlet (as a variable reference, `IBOutlet`) or as an Action (event triggered by the Element `IBAction`) based on their traits. | [ ] | [ ] |
| _Constraints_ |
| Restricting a `UIView` to a position on the screen using `Constraints`. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Programatic Constraints. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I add Elements to my View Controller, **Action:** I add the correct Element that suits the purpose.| [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I add Elements to my Controller, **Action:** I link them as Outlets or Actions based on their traits and the purpose they serve. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to position UI Elements in my View Controller, **Action:** I will use constraints to make sure they are not misplaced on various screen sizes. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Views can respond to input when I assign them an `IBAction`. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Constraints on my UI Elements will make them display properly on all screens. | [ ] | [ ] |
