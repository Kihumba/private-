# Outcome 12 - Views and  Constraints
## Skill Description

The Fellow will be able to create responsive Scenes, with UI View Elements tied with Constraints, responding to Actions and Outlets to be used by the View Controller.

## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. An iOS Project with UI Elements on its View Controller linked to their Outlets and Actions as required with Constraints on the UI Elements that help them maintain their positions across the following Apple device screen sizes
 - iPhone 3.5"
 - iPhone 4.7"
 - iPhone 5.5"
 - iPad 9.7"
 - iPad 12.9"
2. A **Checkpoint 4** project submission meeting all the required specifications.

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I add views to my View Controller, **Action:** I choose an appropriate UI element that suits the purpose| [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I add views to my Controller, **Action:** I link them as Outlets or Actions based on the purpose they serve | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to position UI Elements in my View Controller, **Action:** I will use Constraints to make sure they adapt to various screen sizes | [ ] | [ ] |
