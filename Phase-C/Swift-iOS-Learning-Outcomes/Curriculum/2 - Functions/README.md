# Outcome 2 - Functions
## Skill Description

A function is a block of code that contains procedures that perform an operation(s) and might return a value. Functions are used to house a collection of procedures that are required to run from top to bottom.


## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

- A program in Swift Playground that can parse different data types, and return a result.
- A *function* that takes a *function* as one of its *arguments* and uses it as a callback.

## Objectives

### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| What are *functions?*| [ ] | [ ] |
| What are *arguments* and *parameters?* | [ ] | [ ] |
| How can you make an *argument* optional? | [ ] | [ ] |
| How do you pass *functions* as *arguments* to *functions?* (Callbacks in Swift) | [ ] | [ ] |
| What are the *function* shorthands in Swift? | [ ] | [ ] |
<!-- Missing Ks:
	Syntax for defining *functions*
	The difference between calling a *function* and defining a *function*
	Conventions for using tabs, spaces, and white space in Swift -->

----------
### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to run a collection of procedures that should run from top to bottom with abstracted encapsulated data, **Action:** I use *functions*. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making use of callback *functions* that contain *parameters* that I need to work with directly, **Action:** I use the shorthands available and avoid creating additional variables or references to the *parameters* | [ ] | [ ] |

----------

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Making use of *functions* when I need to run procedures will run them from top to bottom continuously without any interruptions. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I avoid creating redundant variables because its easier to read and more memory efficient. | [ ] | [ ] |
