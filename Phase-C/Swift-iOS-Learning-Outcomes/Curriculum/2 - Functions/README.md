# Outcome 2 - Functions
## Skill Description

A function is a block of code that contains procedures that perform an operation(s) and might return a value. Functions are used to house a collection of procedures that are required to run from top to bottom.


## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

- A program in Swift Playground that can parse different data types, and return a result.
- The function should take an argument, a Function as well, and call it with any argument e.g String, that gets printed out.

- **Detailed and Documented coverage of this skill can be shown by completing _Checkpoint 1_, available upon request.**

## Objectives

### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Functions and methods. [ ] | [ ] |
| Difference between Arguments and Parameters. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Creating `Optional` Arguments. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Passing Functions as Arguments.  (Callbacks in Swift) | [ ] | [ ] |
| Shorthands for Functions in Swift (functional Swift). | [ ] | [ ] |

----------
### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to run a collection of procedures that should run from top to bottom, with abstracted with encapsulated data, **Action:** I use functions. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making use of callback functions that contain Parameters that I need to work with directly, **Action:** I use the shorthands available and avoid creating variables or references to the Parameters | [ ] | [ ] |

----------

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Functions will run my procedures from top to bottom without any interruptions. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Memory is saved when I use Parameters directly, without creating redundant variables references. | [ ] | [ ] |
