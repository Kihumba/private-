# Outcome 10 - Storyboards, Scenes and Segues
## Skill Description

The Fellow will be able to transition from on Scene to another in a Storyboard by attaching Segues to controls in View Controllers(containers) without coding.

## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create the following:

1. An iOS Project containing a Storyboard, and View Controllers (at least 2 abstractions of the View Controller).
2. An iOS Project with controls attached to Segues to move between Scenes.
3. A **Checkpoint 3** project submission meeting all the required specifications.
