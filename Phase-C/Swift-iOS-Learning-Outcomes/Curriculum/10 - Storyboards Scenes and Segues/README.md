## Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When creating Scenes in my application, **Action:** I create them inside a Storyboard. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need create a View Controller / Container, **Action:** I create it inside a Scene. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** To Transition from one Scene to another, **Action:** I will make use of Segues. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When creating user interactive transitions, **Action:** I create the Segues from the  Control element (e.g button) to the Scene. | [ ] | [ ] |


## Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that Segues make it easy to transition between Scenes, without coding. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I believe that the hierarchy _Storyboard_ &gt; _Scenes_ &gt; _Containers_ were created to make the Views of iOS's MVC, objective and easy to manage. | [ ] | [ ] |
