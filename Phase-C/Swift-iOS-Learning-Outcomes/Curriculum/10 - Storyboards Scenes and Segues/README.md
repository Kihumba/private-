# Outcome 10 - Storyboards, Scenes and Segues
## Skill Description

Storyboards are layouts showing the path a user traverses while using your applications. It contains the Scenes and the transitions between the Scenes (Segues).

A scene represents an onscreen content area. A container view controller facilitates navigation and presentation of scenes. Scenes can be connected by relationships or Segues.

## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

- Create an iOS project containing a Storyboard, add View Controllers (Scenes) i.e. Table View Controllers, Tab View Controllers and all other abstractions of the View Controller.

- **Detailed and Documented coverage of this skill can be shown by completing _Checkpoint 3_, available upon request.**

## Objectives
### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The contents or elements of a Storyboard. | [ ] | [ ] |
| The purpose of the Scene in a Storyboard. | [ ] | [ ] |
| The Relationships between containers (View Controllers) and Scenes. |  [ ] | [ ] |
| Transitioning from one Scene to another (Segues). | [ ] | [ ] |
| The transitions styles and modes for Segues.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| Storyboard ID (The optional IDs given to Scenes in Storyboards). | [ ] | [ ] |

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When creating Scenes in my application, **Action:** I create them inside a Storyboard. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need create a View Controller / Container, **Action:** I create it inside a Scene. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** To Transition from one Scene to another, **Action:** I will make use of Segues. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When creating user interactive transitions, **Action:** I create the Segues from the  Control element (e.g button) to the Scene. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Segues give me the ability to transition between Scenes, without coding. | [ ] | [ ] |
| The hierarchy _Storyboard_ &gt; _Scenes_ &gt; _Containers_ gives me control over the flow of my applications UX. | [ ] | [ ] |
