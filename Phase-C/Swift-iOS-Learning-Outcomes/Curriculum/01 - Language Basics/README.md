# Outcome 1 - Language Basics
## Skill Description

The Fellow will be able to use variables and constants were required, and alter the flow of a program using the appropriate control flow statement.

## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create the following:

1. An installation of Xcode 7 or higher and its dependencies on my Mac OS.
2. A program in Swift Playground that uses variables and constants.
3. A Playground Project that processes an input and produces a conditioned output.
4. A Swift Playground Project that processes a collection of data. It should perform the same operation for each item in the collection.
5. A **Checkpoint 1** project submission meeting all the required specifications.

## Objectives
### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| How to use Variables, as a value reference | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to use Constants as immutable variables | [ ] | [ ] |
| Syntax for creating Variables and Constants | [ ] | [ ] |
| The types of Control Flow Statements | [ ] | [ ] |
| The types of Conditionals | [ ] | [ ] |
| The types of Loops | [ ] | [ ] |
| The use cases of Loops and Conditional Statements | [ ] | [ ] |

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need a value reference that could change, **Action:** I create a variable | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When a value shouldn't change, **Action:** I always use a constant instead of a variable to represent it | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When defining variables or constants, **Action:** I use names that are descriptive of what the variables or constants contain | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have procedures to run that depend on a certain input or value, **Action:** I use a conditional expression to change which procedure is run | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have a collection of data to process, **Action:** I use a procedure inside the loop to repeat the operation for each item in the collection | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Appropriate use of variables and constants will make my application run efficiently | [ ] | [ ] |
| Using Loops when I need to repeat a procedure for a number of items in a collection will keep my code [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) | [ ] | [ ] |
| Conditional statements allow me condition an output based on a input | [ ] | [ ] |
