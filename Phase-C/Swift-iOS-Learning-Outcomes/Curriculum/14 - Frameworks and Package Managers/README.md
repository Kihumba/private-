# Outcome 14 - Frameworks and Package Managers

## Skill Description

_Frameworks_ give you access to methods and procedures that have been developed by open-source contributors, operating in efficiency, helping you eliminate the stress of developing these procedures yourself. A lot of Frameworks exists that can help you complete some operations that are ubiquitous, a good example will be 3rd party authentication, which most applications employ.

_Package Managers_ provide a structure to control the Frameworks that are installed and / or used in your application.

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

- Install CocoaPod Package Manager, and install the `AlamoFire` Framework, Use AlamoFire to make a request to GitHub API (fetching the repos of a said user) and embed the result into a table list view.

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need a service that's overly complicated and might pose some redundancy building it from scratch, **Action:** I install and use a Framework that has this service. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need a Framework, **Action:** I install it using a Package Manager. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I use a Framework in my codebase, **Action:** I import the namespace at the top of my script, before my code begins. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I use an iOS SDK Framework, **Action:** I add and reference them in the _Linked Frameworks and Libraries_ section under the _General Tab_ in the Project's Properties. | [ ] | [ ] |
