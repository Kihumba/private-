# Outcome 14 - Frameworks and Package Managers

## Skill Description

_Frameworks_ give you access to methods and procedures that have been developed by open-source contributors, operating in efficiency, helping you eliminate the stress of developing these procedures yourself. A lot of Frameworks exists that can help you complete some operations that are ubiquitous, a good example will be 3rd party authentication, which most applications employ.

_Package Managers_ provide a structure to control the Frameworks that are installed and / or used in your application.

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to do the following:

- Install CocoaPods Package Manager
- Install the `AlamoFire` Framework
- Use AlamoFire to make a request to GitHub API (fetching the repositories of an inputted user) and embed the result into a table list view.

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need a service that is complex, **Action:** I first attempt to find and use a Framework that has this service. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need a Framework, **Action:** I first try to install it using a Package Manager. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need a Framework that can't be installed with a Package Manager, **Action:** I install it manually. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I use a Framework in my codebase, **Action:** I import the namespace at the top of my script, before my code begins. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I use an iOS SDK Framework, **Action:** I add and reference them in the _Linked Frameworks and Libraries_ section under the _General Tab_ in the Project's Properties. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that using Frameworks gives me the power to use complicated services that run super efficiently. | [ ] | [ ] |
