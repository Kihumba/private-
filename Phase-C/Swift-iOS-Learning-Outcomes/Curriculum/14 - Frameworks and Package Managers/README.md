# Outcome 14 - Frameworks and Package Managers

## Skill Description

The Fellow will be able to add Frameworks to their iOS Projects, use them within a Swift Script and manage the Frameworks using a Package Manager.

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create the following:

1. An iOS Swift Project with `AlamoFire` Framework installed via CocoaPods, used to send a request to public API as well as fetching the result.
2. A **Checkpoint 4** project submission meeting all the required specifications.

## Objectives
### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |

|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need a service that's overly complicated and might pose some redundancy building it from scratch, **Action:** I install and use a Framework that has this service | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need a Framework, **Action:** I install it using a Package Manager | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I use a Framework in my codebase, **Action:** I import the namespace at the top of my script, before my code begins | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I use an iOS SDK Framework, **Action:** I add and reference them in the _Linked Frameworks and Libraries_ section under the _General Tab_ in the Project's Properties | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
