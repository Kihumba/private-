# Outcome 5 - Error Handling
## Skill Description

The Fellow will be able to handle errors in an iOS Application, identifying and catching these errors during development, to prevent the application from crashing at runtime.

## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create the following:

1. A Swift Playground project that handles errors generated from bad inputs into a function and performs a different operation to cater for the error thrown that allows for normal operation of the application
2. A Swift Playground Program that throws a custom error when it receives an invalid input, without any form of error handling. The custom Error should be enumerated and caught
3. A Swift Playground Program that catches any generic error as NSError, and outputs the error message.
4. A **Checkpoint 1** project submission meeting all the required specifications


## Objectives
### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The properties of common error class in Swift `NSError` | [ ] | [ ] |
| Types of Error in Swift | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to handle errors in Swift | [ ] | [ ] |

-------

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When throwing Errors that have steps or categories, **Action:** I create an enumerated `ErrorType` that throws different Errors in steps to increase flexibility in the Error Handling | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to perform an operation that could fail, **Action:** I use a try block to catch any error and present a self-explanatory message if it fails | [ ] | [ ] |
