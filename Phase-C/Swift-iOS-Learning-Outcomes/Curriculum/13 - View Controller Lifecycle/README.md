# Outcome 13 - View Controller Lifecycle
## Skill Description

The Fellow will be able to override and customize the Lifecycle methods, to carry out operations to the View Controller based on its state, to control the user experience of the application.

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create the following:

1. An iOS project that overrides the four major View Controller Lifecycle methods logging the state passed at each method.
2. A **Checkpoint 4** project submission meeting all the required specifications.

## Objectives
### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |
| The methods triggered by the states of a View Controller | [ ] | [ ] |
| The frequency at which the Lifecycle methods are called | [ ] | [ ] |
| The order of the _will\*\*_ and the _did\*\*_ Lifecycle methods | [ ] | [ ] |
| The Operations that should be carried out in these functions | [ ] | [ ] |

------

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| When I create a View Controller, I override the methods I need, to run my procedures at the appropriate Application State | [ ] | [ ] |
| When I need to run a procedure in the View Controller, I add my procedure to the `viewWillAppear` function, which runs just before the Views are displayed | [ ] | [ ] |
| When I need to render animations in a View, I add my procedure to the `viewDidAppear` function, which is called just after the View has been rendered | [ ] | [ ] |
| When I need to run a procedure just once in a `UIViewController`, I add the procedure to the `viewDidLoad` function, as it only runs once after the `UIViewController` has been loaded (excluding memory warning exceptions) | [ ] | [ ] |
| When I need to run a procedure just before a ViewController is dismissed, I add my procedure to the `viewWillUnload` function, which runs just before the `viewDidUnload` (read-only) function is called | [ ] | [ ] |

------

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The user experience of my Application can be controlled to the detail when I override the Lifecycle functions | [ ] | [ ] |
