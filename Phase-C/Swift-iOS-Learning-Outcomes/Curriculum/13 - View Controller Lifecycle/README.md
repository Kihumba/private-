# Outcome 13 - View Controller Lifecycle
## Skill Description

These consists of methods that iOS automatically calls at appropriate times when a view controller transitions between states. When you create a view controller subclass, it inherits the methods defined in `UIViewController` and lets you add your own custom behavior for each method (overriding). Itâ€™s important to understand when these methods get called, so you can set up or tear down the views you're displaying at the appropriate state.

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

Create an iOS project that

- Overrides the four major view controller lifecycle functions (highlighted in the Knowledge Objective).
- Has a dummy view controller that presents from any parent viewcontroller. 
- Has Animations will be performed right after the view is rendered, 
- Shows the state in a dialog (and logged in the console) after each state is reached.

## Objectives
### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| What is the lifecycle of a view controller? | [ ] | [ ] |
| What event triggers `viewDidLoad()` to be called, and what state is the View Controller in at that moment| [ ] | [ ] |
| What event triggers `viewDidAppear()` to be called, and what state is the View Controller in at that moment| [ ] | [ ] |
| What event triggers `viewWillUnload()` to be called, and what state is the View Controller in at that moment| [ ] | [ ] |
| What event triggers `viewWillAppear()` to be called, and what state is the View Controller in at that moment| [ ] | [ ] |
| How does one decide what operations should and should not be carried out in the lifecycle functions? | [ ] | [ ] 
| When are the lifecycle functions called? | [ ] | [ ] |
| What are the differences between _will_ lifecycle functions and _did_ lifecycle functions in iOS? | [ ] | [ ] |
<!--| Some other important methods to override in your Controller. |   What other methods? need more details-->
<!-- | `prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: AnyObject?)` | [ ] | [ ] |     This is just a method call name, identify what knowledge of segue lifecycles are important and be sure to include that in the Output. -->

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I create a View Controller **Action:** I override only the lifecycle methods I need | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I write code in a lifecycle method **Action:** it reflects an understanding of what state the view controller is in at that time. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to run a procedure before the view is displayed **Action:**  I add my procedure to the `viewWillAppear` function | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to render animations in a view **Action:**  I add my procedure to the `viewDidAppear` function | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to run a procedure just once in a `UIViewController` **Action:** I add the procedure to the `viewDidLoad` function | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to run a procedure just before a ViewController is dismissed **Action:** I add the procedure to the `viewWillUnload` function | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|

| I believe that overriding the Lifecycle functions gives me the flexibility to control the details of the the user experience. | [ ] | [ ] |
