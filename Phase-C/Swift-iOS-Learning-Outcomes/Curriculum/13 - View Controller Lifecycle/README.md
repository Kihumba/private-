# Outcome 13 - View Controller Lifecycle
## Skill Description

The Fellow will be able to override and customize the Lifecycle methods, to carry out operations to the View Controller based on its state, to control the user experience of the application.

## Output
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create the following:

1. An iOS project that Overrides the four major View Controller Lifecycle methods.
2. An iOS project that has a dummy View Controller that presents from any parent View Controller.
3. An iOS Project that has Animations that will be performed right after the view is rendered.
4. An iOS Project that shows the state of the View Controller in a dialog (and logged in the console) after each state is reached.
5. A **Checkpoint 4** project submission meeting all the required specifications.

## Objectives
### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The Life Cycle of a View Controller | [ ] | [ ] |
| The methods triggered by the states of a View Controller | [ ] | [ ] |
| The frequency at which the Lifecycle methods are called | [ ] | [ ] |
| The order of the _will\*\*_ and the _did\*\*_ Lifecycle methods | [ ] | [ ] |
| The Operations that should be carried out in these Lifecycle methods | [ ] | [ ] |

------

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I create a View Controller **Action:** I override only the lifecycle methods I need | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I write code in a lifecycle method **Action:** it reflects an understanding of what state the view controller is in at that time | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to run a procedure before the view is displayed **Action:**  I add my procedure to the `viewWillAppear` function | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to run a procedure just once in a View Controller **Action:** I add the procedure to the `viewDidLoad` function | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to run a procedure just before a ViewController is dismissed **Action:** I add the procedure to the `viewWillUnload` function | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The user experience of my Application can be controlled to the detail when I override the Lifecycle methods | [ ] | [ ] |
