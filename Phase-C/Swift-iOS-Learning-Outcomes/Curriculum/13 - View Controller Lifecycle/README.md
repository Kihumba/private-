# Outcome 13 - View Controller Lifecycle
## Skill Description

A person with this skill can override and customize the Lifecycle methods, to carry out operations to the View Controller based on its state and control the user experience of the application.

## Output
Create an iOS project that Overrides the four major View Controller Lifecycle methods, and that has Animations that will be performed right after the view is rendered.

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I create a View Controller **Action:** I override only the lifecycle methods I need | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I write code in a lifecycle method **Action:** it reflects an understanding of what state the view controller is in at that time | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to run a procedure before the view is displayed **Action:**  I add my procedure to the `viewWillAppear` function | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to run a procedure just once in a View Controller **Action:** I add the procedure to the `viewDidLoad` function | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to run a procedure just before a ViewController is dismissed **Action:** I add the procedure to the `viewWillUnload` function | [ ] | [ ] |
