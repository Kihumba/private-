# Outcome 2 - Functions
## Skill Description

The Fellow will be able to use functions to encapsulate and run procedures, using shorthands (Functional Swift Syntax) in scenarios were it can be applied.


## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create the following:

1. A function in Swift Playground that can parse different data types and return a result depending on the parameters' data types present
2. A **Checkpoint 1** project submission meeting all the required specifications

## Objectives

### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |
| Functions and methods | [ ] | [ ] |
| Difference between Arguments and Parameters | [ ] | [ ] |
| The use cases `Optional` Arguments | [ ] | [ ] |
| Callback functions in Swift | [ ] | [ ] |
| The Function shorthands in Swift | [ ] | [ ] |

----------
### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to run a collection of procedures that should run from top to bottom, with abstracted with encapsulated data, **Action:** I use functions | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making use of callback functions that contain Parameters that I need to work with directly, **Action:** I use the shorthands available and avoid creating variables or copies of the Parameters | [ ] | [ ] |

----------

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Functions will run my procedures from top to bottom without any interruptions | [ ] | [ ] |
| Memory is conserved when I use Parameters directly without creating redundant variables | [ ] | [ ] |
