# Outcome 2 - Functions
## Skill Description

The Fellow will be able to use *functions* to encapsulate and run procedures, using shorthands (Functional Swift Syntax) in scenarios were it can be applied.


## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will create the following:

1. A *function* in Swift Playground that can parse different data types and return a result depending on the parameters' data types present
2. A *function* that takes a *function* as one of its *arguments* and uses it as a callback

## Objectives

### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Function declaration syntax | [ ] | [ ] |
| The difference between calling and defining a *function* | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to use Functions and parameters | [ ] | [ ] |
| The difference between Arguments and Parameters | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to make an argument optional | [ ] | [ ] |

----------
### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to run a collection of procedures that should run from top to bottom with abstracted encapsulated data, **Action:** I use *functions* | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making use of callback *functions* that contain parameters that I need to work with directly, **Action:** I use the shorthands available and avoid creating additional variables or references to the parameters | [ ] | [ ] |

----------

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Functions will run my procedures from top to bottom continuously without any interruptions. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Memory is conserved when I use parameters directly without creating redundant variables. | [ ] | [ ] |
