#Outcome 6- Testing in Ruby (TDD)

Skill Description
---------- 
A person with this skill uses Test Driven Development consistently throughout their Ruby programming process. They can explain the overriding concepts of TDD, and are fluent in writing test cases using both RSpec and Minitest libraries. 

Outputs
----------
<li/> **Task:** Test your command line app as it is, and try to work through fixing any bugs/errors. 
<li/> **Resources:** Using Test Driven Development, go back and re-build the simple app in command line with TDD steps included along the way. 
<li/> **Include:**  N/A

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am writing a program in Ruby, **Action:**I consistently build in and run tests throughout my development process.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I come across a bug in my code, **Action:** I write only enough code to fix that problem, then re-run the test.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have fixed the bug so my code is running, **Action:** I refactor to make sure the code is as clean as possible.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have Ruby code that needs to be tested, **Action:** I install the RSpec Gem through command line.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I implement an RSpec test, **Action:** I consider if I can make my test more idiomatic.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am writing a Ruby application, **Action:** I use exception loggers to write messages in the code when I have errors.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
