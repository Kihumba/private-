# Outcome 16 - Testing my Rails App

Skill Description
----------
A person with this skill can describe the importance of BDD and TDD in Rails. They consistently use Rails testing best practices in their application development, and are familiar with the most effective tools to do so. 

Output
----------
- **Task:**  Test a simple Rails app that you have created as it is, and try to work through fixing the errors. 
- **Resources:** Then, go back and use Capybara Gem as you rebuild your application, implementing TDD as you build.
