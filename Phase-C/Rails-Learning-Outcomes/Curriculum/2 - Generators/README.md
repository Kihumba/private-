## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to scaffold an entire resource, from model and migration to controller and
    views, along with a full test suite... **Action:** I use the "rails generate scaffold" command | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to stub out a model... **Action:** I use the "rails generate model" command | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to stub out a new controller and its views... **Action:** I use the "rails generate controller" command | [ ] | [ ]  |
