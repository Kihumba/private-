# Outcome 2 - Generators

Skill Description
----------
The fellow understand how to use built in generators as well as custom generators to improve development workflow and reduce rework.

Outputs
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:
- A writeup explaining how rails generator helped him/her to improve development speed.
- A clone of model generator called `my_model` used like this: rails generate my_model MODEL_NAME

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to scaffold an entire resource, from model and migration to controller and views, along with a full test suite... **Action:** I use the "rails generate scaffold" command | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to stub out a model... **Action:** I use the "rails generate model" command | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to stub out a new controller and its views... **Action:** I use the "rails generate controller" command | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to create a database migration class... **Action:** I use the "rails generate migration" command | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to stub out a new helper... **Action:** I use the "rails generate helper" command | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to stub out a new resource including an empty model and controller suitable for a restful, resource-oriented application... **Action:** I use the "rails generate resource" command | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to stub out a new rake task... **Action:** I use the "rails generate task" command | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When stubbing out rails application files... **Action:** I reduce rework by taking advantage of inbuilt generators. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When working on repetitive tasks... **Action:** I create custom generators if there are no inbuilt generators to handle the task. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When building a rails application... **Action:** I tweak generator settings to suit my workflow. | [ ] | [ ]  |
