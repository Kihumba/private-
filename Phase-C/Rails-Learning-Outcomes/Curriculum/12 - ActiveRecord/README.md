# Outcome 12 - ActiveRecord

Skill Description
----------
A person with this skill can use ActiveRecord within the Rails framework to access a database. They can explain how ActiveRecord fits into the MVC paradigm, 

Outputs
----------

<li/> **Resources:** You should also write the necessary ActiveRecord queries for retrieving data from the database.
<li/> **Include:** N/A

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When working with a database in any Rails application **Action:** I use an ORM  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When performing CRUD operations on my database **Action:** I use ActiveRecord to construct my queries | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When retrieving related model data that might not be used **Action:** I use `lazy loading` or `lazy evaluation` | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When retrieving related model data that are used everywhere with the main model **Action:** I use `eager loading` or `eager evaluation`  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to retrieve a single record from the database based on the model attribute **Action:** I use the `find_by` method | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to retrieve a single record based on the primary key of a table **Action:** I use the `find` method | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I need a custom chain of ActiveRecord methods **Action:** I use ActiveRecord `scopes` | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to create relationships between different models **Action:** I use ActiveRecord association | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I need to pre-load (eager load) scopes **Action:** I turn them into associations instead | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to chain built-in scopes into larger scopes **Action:** I use class methods | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I need to enforce data integrity in a SQL statement with multiple actions **Action:** I use a transaction class or an instance method | [ ] | [ ]  |
