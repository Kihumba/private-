# Outcome

Skill Description
----------
This outcome introduces the rails controller which is the logical center of an application. The controller coordinates the interaction between the user, the views, and the model.


Outputs
----------
1. In checkpoints and simulation projects, 
	+ Write slim controllers
	+ Use strong parameters

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Why is it important what you name your models, controllers, and views? | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Where is the view file located that's rendered by default for a given controller? | [ ] | [ ]  |
| What's the difference between a #render and a #redirect_to? | [ ] | [ ]  |
| What happens to the controller's instance variables in each case? | [ ] | [ ]  |
| What is a shortcut for redirecting to a specific Post (tip: this works in all kinds of places like #link_to and #*_path) | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Does a method finish executing or get interrupted when it hits a#render or #redirect_to? | [ ] | [ ]  |
| What happens if you have multiple renders or redirects? | [ ] | [ ]  |
| What are Strong Parameters? | [ ] | [ ]  |
| When can you just use the params hash directly and when do you need to specifically "whitelist" its contents? | [ ] | [ ]  |
| What are "scalar" values? | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When creating a controller, **Action:** I follow rails controller naming convention. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When getting user data from input fields, **Action:** I use strong parameters to whitelist its contents? | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When building a rails application, **Action:**  I make my controllers very slim by delegating tasks to models and other poro classes. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When sending status messages to the view, **Action:** I use flash objects. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to render status messages on the same page, **Action:** I use “flash.now” | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When retrieving data passed by a user,  **Action:** I access the params object. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want render status messages, **Action:** I use the appropriate flash keys (i.e error, notice, etc.) | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**



| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Controllers should be slim. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Controllers are the backbone of a rails application. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| It pays to use strong parameters to whitelist user data. | [ ] | [ ]  |
