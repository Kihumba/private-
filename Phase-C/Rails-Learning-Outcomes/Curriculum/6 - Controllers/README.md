# Outcome

Skill Description
----------
The Fellow can effectively use the Rails controller, which is the logical center of an application. The controller coordinates the interaction between the user, the views, and the model.


Outputs
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to write slim controllers and strong parameters into my application.

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When creating a controller **Action:** I follow the Rails controller naming convention. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When getting user data from input fields **Action:** I use strong parameters to whitelist their contents | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When structuring and refactoring Rails controllers **Action:**  I make my controllers very slim by delegating tasks to models and other poro classes | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When sending status messages to the view **Action:** I use flash objects | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to render status messages on the same page **Action:** I use “flash.now” | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When retrieving data passed by a user  **Action:** I access the params object | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**



| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Slim controllers make my code beautiful (and thus readable). | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Slim’s syntax is guided by one very cool motto: “What's the minimum required to make this work?” | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Strong parameters give me the power to whitelist user data without listing accessable fields in my model. | [ ] | [ ]  |
