# Outcome

Skill Description
----------
When you generate a Ruby on Rails application it will create 3 different environments: development, production and test. This makes it possible to configure the Ruby on Rails framework in different mode depending on state of the rails application.

Outputs
----------
In checkpoint and simulation projects,
- appropriately use rails environments.
- use figaro gem to manage environment variables.

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When adding a gem in the Gemfile... **Action:** I add the gem to the appropriate group/environment. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When running tests for a rails application... **Action:** I set the application to use rails test environment. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When developing a rails application locally... **Action:** I set the application to use rails development environment. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When deploying a rails application... **Action:** I set the application to use rails production environment. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When building out a rails application... **Action:** I use different settings for different environments. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When using sensitive configurations data in a rails application... **Action:** I use environment variables to store the data. | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| All sensitive configurations data should be stored using environment variables. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Environment variables makes it easier to configure application settings. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The whole goal of having multiple environments is to reduce the rework of reconfiguring settings each time you want to deploy or test your application. | [ ] | [ ]  |
