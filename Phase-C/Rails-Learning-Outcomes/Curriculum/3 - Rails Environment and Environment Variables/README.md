# Outcome 3 - Rails Environment and Environment Variables

Skill Description
----------
The fellow understands the need to have multiple environments eg development, production and test in an application and how rails makes it possible to work with multiple environment. Has a complete understanding of environment variables and why they should always be used.

Outputs
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:
- A rails project that appropriately use rails environments
- A rails project that uses figaro gem to manage environment variables

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| All sensitive configurations data should be stored using environment variables. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Environment variables makes it easier to configure application settings. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The whole goal of having multiple environments is to reduce the rework of reconfiguring settings each time you want to deploy or test your application. | [ ] | [ ]  |
