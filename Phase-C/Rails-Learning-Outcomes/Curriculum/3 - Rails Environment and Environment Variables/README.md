# Outcome

Skill Description
----------
When you generate a Ruby on Rails application it will create 3 different environments: development, production and test. This makes it possible to configure the Ruby on Rails framework in different mode depending on state of the rails application.

Outputs
----------
In checkpoint and simulation projects,
- appropriately use rails environments.
- use figaro gem to manage environment variables.
