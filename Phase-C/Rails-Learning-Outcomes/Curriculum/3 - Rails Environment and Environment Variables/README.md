# Outcome 3 - Rails Environment and Environment Variables

Skill Description
----------
The Fellow uses multiple environments (eg. development, production and test) while developing a Rails application, and knows why environment variables should always be used.

Outputs
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create a Rails project that appropriately uses Rails environments and uses Figaro gem to manage environment variables.
