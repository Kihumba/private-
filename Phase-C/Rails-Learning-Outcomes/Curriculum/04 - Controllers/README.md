# Outcome 4- Controllers

Skill Description
----------
A person with this skill generates Rails controllers to coordinate the interaction between the user, the views, and the model of their application. They consistently use “slim” controllers for the most efficient code. 


Outputs
----------
<li/> **Task:** Using a new Rails application or one you’ve been working on, generate a controller with appropriate view files, index, and show actions. 
<li/> **Resources:**: Be sure to use slim controllers and strong parameters. 
<li/> **Include:** N/A

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When creating a controller **Action:** I follow the Rails controller naming conventions. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I need help remembering how to use controllers **Action:** I access the controller help page by running `rails generate controller` in command line. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When getting user data from input fields in my app **Action:** I use strong parameters to whitelist their contents. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When refactoring Rails controllers **Action:**  I make my controllers very slim by delegating tasks to models and other poro classes. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When sending status messages to the view **Action:** I use flash objects. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When retrieving data passed by a user  **Action:** I access the params object. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to render status messages **Action:** I use the appropriate flash keys (i.e error, notice, etc.). | [ ] | [ ]  |
