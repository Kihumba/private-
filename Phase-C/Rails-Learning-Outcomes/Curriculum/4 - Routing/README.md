# Outcome 4 - Routing

Skill Description
----------
The Fellow fully understand the role of a router in an MVC architecture including how the router maps http request to controller action. The fellow can also articulate the different ways routes are created in a rails application including use cases where it makes sense to use one approach over the other.

Outputs
----------

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:
- A rails api project that makes use of route namespace to version it's API
- A rails project that uses route helper methods
- A rails project that appropriately makes use of resources and nested resources to create restful endpoints

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to create all seven restful route for a resource **Action:** I use the `resources` method| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When adding links to my views **Action:** I use route helper methods as against adding the raw link| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When defining routes for an application **Action:** I always specify a `root` route| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to know the different routes supported by my application **Action:** I use the `rake routes` command| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When auto generated route names are too complex or hard to remember **Action:** I explicitly name my routes| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When building out an API **Action:** I namespace my routes| [ ] | [ ]  |
