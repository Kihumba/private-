# Outcome 4 - Routing

Skill Description
----------
The Fellow can explain the use of a router in an MVC architecture, including how the router maps http request to controller action. The fellow can also articulate the different ways routes are created in a Rails application including use cases where it makes sense to use one approach over the other.

Outputs
----------

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create a Rails API project that makes use of routing though namespace, helper methods, and nested resources.

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to create all seven restful routes for a resource **Action:** I use the `resources` method| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When adding links to my views **Action:** I use route helper methods instead of adding the raw link| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When defining routes for an application **Action:** I always specify a `root` route| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to know the different routes supported by my application **Action:** I use the `rake routes` command| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When auto generated route names are too complex or hard to remember **Action:** I explicitly name my routes| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When building out an API **Action:** I namespace my routes| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When creating restful endpoints **Action:** I use resources and nesed resources | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| If I want my web applications to be scalable, I must have well defined routes(restful endpoints)| [ ] | [ ]  |
| Route helper methods allow me "DRY" up my code and avoid duplication| [ ] | [ ]  |
