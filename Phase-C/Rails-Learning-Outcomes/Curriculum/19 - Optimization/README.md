# Outcome - Optimization

Skill Description
----------
An optimized application is very critical and knowing how to optimize an application is a very important skill to have. This outcome treats common optimization issues as well as ways to handle or curb those issues.

Outputs
----------
- Write a blog post on scaling rails applications.
- Implement optimization techniques in checkpoints and simulation project.

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When my rails application is slow... **Action:** I first of all identify the cause.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When the size of my applicationâ€™s user base can no longer be handled by my rails application... **Action:** I scale the application from my hosted provider.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When building a rails application... **Action:** I use Unicorn as my default rails server.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When working with static resources like images, javascript and css in a rails application... **Action:** I offload those resources to another domain/host like AWS S3.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When working on a rails application that deals heavily with static pages... **Action:** I use actionpack-page_caching gem to cache the static content of the pages.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When working on a rails application that handle authentication on pages... **Action:** I use the actionpack-action_caching gem to cache authentication actions.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to cache a section of my view logic... **Action:** I use fragment caching to serve out the cache store when next a request for that section is made.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to cache a value or a query result... **Action:** I use rails low-level caching mechanism by invoking Rails.cache.fetch method.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am working with a query that would be evoked at several instances... **Action:** I use SQL caching mechanism to cache the result of the query for subsequent requests.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to represent string from a database as a Hash... **Action:** I implement serialization myself as against using serializers.| [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Rails is a nice framework but when misused performance is hit hard.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| Optimizing a Rails application is easy.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| 80% of speedup comes from memory optimization, remaining 20% from everything else.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| The performance of my application is mostly tied to memory consumption.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| Performance and Scalability are not the same.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| An application will not scale if it is not designed to scale.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| Writing better and leaner code aids application performance.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| Everything should be as simple as possible but not simpler.| [ ] | [ ]  |
