# Output 9- Advanced Databases

## Skill Description
A person with this skill is fluent in administration, optimization, and querying for at least one SQL and one NoSQL database. They can explain how databases work on a high level, including how data and indexes are stored. 

## Output
- **Task:** Create an application that uses SQL or NoSQL to query a database. Make sure that you optimize your database for performance. 
- **Resources:** Use whatever SQL/NoSQL language and database is most appropriate for your goals. 
- **Include:** An explanation of the database and language you chose.

**Bonus Output:** If you did the Output above using NoSQL, repeat with SQL (or vice versa).

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am mirroring a database, **Action:** I ensure that the principal and the mirror share a Distributor. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am using multiple tasks to access my database in parallel, **Action:** I use partitioning to optimize my database performance. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I build a database, **Action:** I always leave free space in my database for growth.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** As my database grows, **Action:** I continually monitor and change any database objects that become inefficient.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When my database has become inefficient, **Action:** I realign and restructure the database objects.  | [ ] | [ ]  |

|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| No amount of system tuning can optimize a poorly designed or disorganized database. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| My database will change over time and with use, and I must be prepared to refactor it accordingly.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
