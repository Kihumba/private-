# Output 6-  Code Organization, Structure, & Design

## Skill Description
A person with this skill has an impeccable code design mindset that they use to help improve both UI/UX design, as well as high-level design patterns and code structure. They can visualize and design programs with multiple product lines, external integrations, and interacting systems.

## Output
- **Task:**  Using a code base from someone on your team, in a published application, or in the open source community, highlight the main code design & structure principles that you notice it making use of. 
- **Resources:** You can choose to illustrate or explain through whatever medium you find most effective. 
- **Include:** Share with your team and get feedback on other design aspects you missed. 

## Alternative Output: 
- **Task:**  Using a visual design from someone on your team or in the open source community, scan the design and build it as closely as possible in source code. 
- **Resources:** Use the most effective programming language and code structure to create the product. 
- **Include:** Share this build with the designer if possible.

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When writing code, **Action:** I avoid deep nesting of conditionals or methods.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am working as a member of a team, **Action:** I keep code structure in mind and suggest improvements where I see opportunities to make code more efficient.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am working as a member of a team, **Action:** I keep user experience in the front of my mind and suggest design improvements where I see opportunities to better interact with the user.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When a designer sends me a picture of something to create, **Action:** I first scan it and outline how to convert it into source code.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have determined what I can and cannot create in source code based on a designer’s wireframe, **Action:** I always explain to the designer any deviations I need to make from the design and why.  | [ ] | [ ]  |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| When I am programming, I am communicating to other developers who will use my code, and must do so in the clearest possible way.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| A great developer can anticipate performance bottlenecks but knows not to pre-optimize
| My files should look beautiful.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Code organization is not just “pretty:” it is critical to highly functional and usable code. | [ ] | [ ]  |
