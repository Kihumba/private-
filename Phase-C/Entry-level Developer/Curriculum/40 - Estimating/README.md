# Outcome 40 - Estimating

**Skill Description**
----------
<<<<<<< HEAD
The Fellow is able to systematically break down work into individual tasks and provide estimates on each to ultimately derive an estimate on the level of effort and time required to complete the work. The Fellow is able to defend how they came up with an estimate.

The Fellow is able to systematically break down work into individual tasks and provide estimates on each to ultimately derive an estimate on the LOE/time required to complete the work.  They should also be able to defend how they came up with the estimate. (Estimates at this stage are not expected to be 100% accurate)

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. A log of task estimates and the actual time it took to complete the tasks with reflections on the cause of variance

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before I begin assigned work **Action:** I break down the work into smaller individual tasks | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After breaking down the work into smaller individual tasks **Action:** I estimate the LOE/time it will take to complete those tasks | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After estimating the LOE for the tasks **Action:** I communicate the estimates with relevant stakeholders while providing justifications for the estimates | [ ] | [ ] |
<<<<<<< HEAD
| **Context:** After the tasks have been completed **Action:** I compare the actual LOE to the estimated LOE to re-calibrate my ability to estimate accurately | [ ] | [ ] |
