# Outcome 32 - Security

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands the basics of application security including authentication, authorization, encryption of sensitive data, and input validation.

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

1. A project implementing authentication, authorization, encryption of sensitive data, and input validation


**Objectives**

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When building a feature that requires users to have private access to their data **Action:** I use the appropriate authentication mechanism | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When building a feature that requries users to have different levels of access to data **Action:** I use the appropriate authorization mechanism | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When building a feature to store potentially sensitive data **Action:** I use the appropriate encryption mechanism to encrypt the data before saving | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When building a feature that takes user input **Action:** I validate and sanitize the input at both the front-end and backend | [ ] | [ ] |
