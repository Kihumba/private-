# Outcome 14 - Problem Solving & Critical Thinking

## Skill Description

The Fellow is able to use generic methods (when they are available) or ad hoc methods (when generic methods are not available) in an orderly manner to find solutions to problems. The Fellow utilizes problem solving processes and sequences to effectively solve complex problems.


## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

1. Written description of a coding problem I recently solved and the steps taken to solve the problem
2. Written description of a non-coding problem I recently solved and the steps taken to solve the problem

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior | Practiced | Observed |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| | | |
| **Context:** When I identify a problem that requires my attention | | |
| - **Action:** I accurately define the problem and its context | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I define the process I will use to solve the problem, rather than immediately taking action (e.g. beginning to write code) | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I ensure the problem solving process is appropriate for the specific task | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When none of the generic problem solving methods apply to a specific problem | | | 
| - **Action:** I ideate ad hoc methods to solve the problem | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I collaborate with others for a second opinion | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I find myself using “brute force”, guess and check methods to find a solution to a problem **Action:** I stop and find more efficient and procedural methods | [ ] | [ ] |
