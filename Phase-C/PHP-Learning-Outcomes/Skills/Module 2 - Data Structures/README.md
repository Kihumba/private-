## Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:**  When I want to store one or more values in a single variable **Action:**  I make use of arrays.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want a simple map value dataset **Action:** I use a ‘key,value’ array.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to perform operations on arrays **Action:** I identify and use the appropriate array function that suits the operation.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am working with large data sets **Action:**  I save memory by using generators. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am working with a list of values **Action:** I use Iterators to traverse the collection.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am using Generators in my PHP program **Action:** I assign the value to a variable and let PHP automatically detect the type. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When working on a program in PHP **Action:** I take advantage of the SPL classes and methods. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
