# Module 1: PHP Language Basics - KBBs
**Summary:**
The learning outcomes expected of a fellow that has covered this module are as follows:
- Control flow and structure.
- The various primitive data types in PHP.
- Operators.
- Functions.
- Variables and Constants.
- Language Constructs and Coding Standards.
- Try-catch and finally statement in PHP to handle exceptions.
- Super Global Variables in PHP.

The following are the Outputs, Knowledge, Behaviors, and Beliefs for PHP Language Basics


## **Outputs**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. A program in PHP that uses variables and constants.
2. A program in PHP that can parse different data types, and return a result.
3. A PHP Project on [repl](https://repl.it/languages/php) that processes an input and produces a conditioned output.
4. A PHP Project on [repl](https://repl.it/languages/php) that processes a collection of data. It should perform the same operation for each item in the collection.
5. In the PHP [Repl](https://repl.it/languages/php) Playground, write a program that compares various values in 3 different arrays and gets the sum of those values that are greater than 20 and less than 52.
6. A program in PHP that passes data from one file to another.

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to define variables or constants... **Action:** I use names that are descriptive of what the variables or constants contain.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I need to run a collection of procedures that should run from top to bottom... **Action:** I will make use of functions when I need to run. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have procedures to run, that depend on a certain input or value... **Action:** I will use a conditional expression to cater for the optional procedure to run. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have to loop through a collection of data, where some elements donâ€™t need alteration... **Action:** I will use break and continue to cater for such process.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I need to create, reference or manipulate data... **Action:** I will just assign the value to a variable and let PHP automatically detect the type. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I want to perform an arithmetic operation... **Action:**  I will use one of the available arithmetic operators.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I write a piece of code in PHP... **Action:** I will ensure it follows the PSR-2 standards.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I am working a project that involves several classes and PHP files... **Action:**   I will ensure it follows the PSR-4 autoloading standard.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I need to retrieve the values of a GET and POST request... **Action:** I will make use of a super global variable.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to maintain state across files... **Action:** I will make use of a $_SESSION superglobal variable.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can make use of superglobal variables when I need to pass data from one file to another without losing state.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| I can make use of superglobal variables when making various web requests such as GET or POST.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Knowing how to use the available operators in PHP will allow me perform better computations.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I can use conditional statements to express optional procedures based off an input or value that should affect the output of a process.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I can make use of functions when I need to run procedures, from top to bottom without any implied interruptions.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Using variables and constants appropriately will make my programs more efficient and readable.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
