# Module 1: PHP Language Basics
**Skill Description:**
PHP is a script language used primarily on Linux web servers. The Fellow with this skill is comfortable with the flow, data types, and structure of PHP, as well as the language constructs and coding standards when using PHP. 


## **Outputs**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create a program in PHP that works with data files.

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to define variables or constants **Action:** I use names that are descriptive of what the variables or constants contain.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have procedures to run that depend on a certain input or value **Action:** I use a conditional expression to cater for the optional procedure to run. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have to loop through a collection of data **Action:** I use Break and Continue for the process.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I need to create, reference or manipulate data **Action:** I simply assign the value to a variable and let PHP automatically detect the type. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I want to perform an arithmetic operation **Action:**  I use one of the available arithmetic operators.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I write a piece of code in PHP **Action:** I ensure it follows the PSR-2 standards.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I am working a project that involves several classes and PHP files **Action:**   I ensure it follows the PSR-4 autoloading standard.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I need to retrieve the values of a GET and POST request **Action:** I make use of a Super Global variable.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
