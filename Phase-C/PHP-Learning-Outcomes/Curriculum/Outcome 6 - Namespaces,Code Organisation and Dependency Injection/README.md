# Outcome 6 -  Namespaces, Code Organisation and Dependency Injection using Composer

**Skill Description**

The learning outcomes expected of a fellow that has covered this module are as follows:
- Namespacing and aliasing.
- Application of namespacing in Classes, Traits, Interfaces and Object Oriented Code.
- Principles of modular application design.
- Dependency Injection using Composer and the composer package library Packagist.
- The concept of PSR-4 and PSR-2 Autoloading.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. A PHP Program that contains at least 3 different classes that are namespaced and interact with each other.
2. [Checkpoint 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vRZsAI8BJTq8t0-ewZvtxyT9PviY2LtvSqzlfM00jPY)

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to write a PHP Package that involves a bunch of Classes **Action:**  I namespace the classes and use the PSR-4 Autoloading Standard.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:**  When I am writing reusable code **Action:** I namespace it.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I write a PHP Package **Action:**  I upload it to Packagist using Composer to make it available for everyone. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to write a PHP application **Action:**  I use composer to manage and autoload all my code dependencies. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to achieve multiple inheritance in a PHP program **Action:**  I use Traits. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to write a loosely coupled PHP program **Action:**  I use the Dependency Injection concept. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
