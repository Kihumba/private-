# Outcome 3 - Test Driven Development in PHP using PHPUnit &  PHPSpec

**Skill Description**
----------

The learning outcomes expected of a fellow that has covered this module are as follows:
- Installing the PHPUnit package.
- TDD and how to write unit tests for applications using PHPUnit.
- The concepts of functional testing and how to implement this using Selenium and PHPUnit.
- The concepts of Behavior Driven Development and how to implement this using PHPSpec.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. Checkpoint 4 with Functional, Unit and Integrated tests written for it.
