# Module 5: Object Oriented Programming in PHP - KBBs

**Summary:**
The learning outcomes expected of a fellow that has covered this module are as follows:
- Understand Object oriented programming concepts, classes and objects.
- Understand and implement concepts of Inheritance, Polymorphism and Encapsulation, among others, in PHP programming.
- Understand the concept of Traits, Interfaces and Abstraction in PHP.
- Understand the concept of type-hinting non-scalar and scalar values in PHP.
- Understand the concept of Inversion of Control in PHP.
- Understand the concept of Method overloading using __call() and __callStatic().
- Understand and use PHP magic methods available to objects and how to use them e.g Getters, Setters and Destructors.
- Understand Object Serialization in PHP.


The following are the Outputs, Knowledge, Behaviors, and Beliefs for Callbacks and Closures.

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want a collection of methods, properties or attributes that I need to re-use.. **Action:**  I will create a Class that contains this methods and attributes, and create instances of that Class when I need to.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:**  When I need to create a Class that that needs some existing behaviours already present in another Class...**Action:**I will create a Class that inherits these behaviours from another Class.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to access classes, function and variables... **Action:**  I will import the encapsulating namespace and reference them accordingly. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that knowing the essentials of object oriented programming will allow me write well decoupled and reusable code.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| I believe I can use the concept of Inheritance and Abstraction to avoid writing duplicated  blocks of code. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I believe every thing in the real world can be modelled in terms of objects interacting with each other. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
