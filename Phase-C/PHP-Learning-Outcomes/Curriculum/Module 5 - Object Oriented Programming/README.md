# Module 5: Object Oriented Programming in PHP

**Skill Description**
Object Oriented Programming in PHP specifically has several distinct and important concepts. The Fellow with this skill is comfortable with the concepts of Traits, Interface, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Encapsulation in PHP programming.


## **Outputs**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create a PHP program using OOP and object serialization.

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to reuse a collection of methods, properties or attributes **Action:**  I create an instance of a class that contains those collections. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:**  When I need to create a class that needs some existing behaviors already present in another class **Action:** I create a class that inherits these behaviors.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to access classes, function and variables **Action:**  I import the encapsulating namespace and reference them accordingly. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The essentials of object oriented programming allows one to write well decoupled and reusable code.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| Inheritance and Abstraction are essential techniques that can be employed to avoid writing duplicated blocks of code. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Every thing in the real world can be modeled in terms of objects interacting with each other. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
