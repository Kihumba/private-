# Module 7:  Working with Databases - KBBs

**Summary:**
The learning outcomes expected of a fellow that has covered this module are as follows:
- Native PHP syntax for connecting to database, querying databases and working with query results using MySQLi (MySQLi).
- PDO, a database agnostic PHP component, and how to use it to perform more complex database operations like Prepared Statements, Stored Procedures and Transactions.

The following are the Outputs, Knowledge, Behaviors, and Beliefs for Working with Databases.

## **Outputs**
