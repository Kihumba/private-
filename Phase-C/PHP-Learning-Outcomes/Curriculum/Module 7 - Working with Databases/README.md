| **Context:** When I want to write a PHP program that can connect to any database without rewriting the codebase **Action:**  I use PDO. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:**  When I am writing a PHP program that strictly requires a MYSQL database **Action:** I use the PHP MYSQLi driver. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I write a complex query **Action:** I use ‘IN’ as opposed to multiple ‘OR’s to search one value repeatedly. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
