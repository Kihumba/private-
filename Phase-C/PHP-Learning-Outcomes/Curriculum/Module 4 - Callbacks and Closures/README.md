# Module 4: Callbacks and Closures

**Skill Description**
Callbacks and Closures are used in modern day PHP frameworks when it does not make sense to define a function. The Fellow with this skill effectively implements both callbacks and closures in their PHP programming. 

## **Outputs**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create a PHP program using functional programming techniques.
