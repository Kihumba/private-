# Module 4: Callbacks and Closures - KBBs

**Summary:**
The learning outcomes expected of a fellow that has covered this module are as follows:
- Callbacks and closures in PHP and their applications.
- Practical applications of Callables in PHP like in the array_walk() function.
- Application of callbacks and closures in modern day PHP frameworks.


The following are the Outputs, Knowledge, Behaviors, and Beliefs for Callbacks and Closures.


## **Outputs**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. A PHP program on [REPL](https://repl.it/languages/php) to showcase functional programming techniques

## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Memorized |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| What are anonymous functions(lambdas) in PHP? | [ ] | [ ] |
| What are callbacks in PHP? | [ ] | [ ] |
| What are closures in PHP and their relation to the Closure class? | [] | [] |
| How are callbacks and closures used in frameworks and functional programming procedures?| [] | [] |


----------


## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am writing a program.. **Action:** I will use lambdas to pass functions as arguments to other functions. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:**  When I am writing callbacks and Closures in a PHP program...**Action:** I will type-hint them with the callback type and Closure class.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am writing a PHP program that involves passing functions as arguments... **Action:**  I will use callbacks and Closures to achieve that. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Callbacks and closures are essential for functional programming.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| Lambdas and closures are handy alternatives for named functions. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I can use closures in place of lambdas to access variables outside the scope of anonymous functions.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Lambdas can come in handy when building components for a larger system to allow for flexibility for developer use. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Closures can be used as callbacks. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
