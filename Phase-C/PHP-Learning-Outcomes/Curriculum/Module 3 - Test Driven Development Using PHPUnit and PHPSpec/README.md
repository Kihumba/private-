# Module 3: Test Driven Development in PHP using PHPUnit &  PHPSpec - KBBs

**Summary:**
The learning outcomes expected of a fellow that has covered this module are as follows:
- Understand how to install the PHPUnit package.
- Understand TDD and how to write unit tests for applications using PHPUnit.
- Understand the concepts of functional testing and how to implement this using Selenium and PHPUnit.
- Understand the concepts of Behaviour Driven Development and how to implement this using PHPSpec.

The following are the Outputs, Knowledge, Behaviors, and Beliefs for PHP Data Structures.

## **Outputs**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. A PHP project with custom Test cases setup.
2. A PHP Project(UI and Javascript included) with functional tests written for it.
