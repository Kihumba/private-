# Outcome 4 - Callbacks and Closures

**Skill Description**

The learning outcomes expected of a fellow that has covered this module are as follows:
- Callbacks and closures in PHP and their applications.
- Practical applications of Callables in PHP prominent in the array_walk() function.
- Application of callbacks and closures in modern day PHP frameworks.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. A PHP program on [REPL](https://repl.it/languages/php) to showcase functional programming techniques.
