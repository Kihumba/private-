# Module 2: PHP Data Structures
**Summary:**
PHP Data Structures allow the Fellow to work with arrays and SPL data structures to write effient and effective code. 
The Fellow with this skill has a thorough understanding of PHP Data Structures and how to use them.

## **Outputs**

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:**  When I want to store one or more values in a single variable **Action:**  I make use of arrays.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to perform operations on arrays**Action:** I identify and use the appropriate array function that suits the operation.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am working with large data sets **Action:**  I save memory by using generators. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am working with a list/collection of values **Action:** I use Iterators to traverse the collection.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When working with Generators **Action:** I assign the value to a variable and let PHP automatically detect the type. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When working on a program that involves a collection of values **Action:**  I make use of SPL data structures.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When working on a program in PHP **Action:** I take advantage of the SPL classes and methods where necessary to aid efficiency and save development time.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
