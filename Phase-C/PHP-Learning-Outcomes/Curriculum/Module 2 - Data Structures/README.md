# Module 2: PHP Data Structures - KBBs
**Summary:**
The learning outcomes expected of a fellow that has covered this module are as follows:
- Understand what arrays are and how to work with them.
- Understand the different types of array available in PHP and how to traverse them using the foreach function.
- Have a thorough understanding of a vast majority of the operations possible with arrays including the list function and array sort functions.
- Understand the concept of Iterators and Generators in PHP.
- Understand what the SPL is and how to use SPL functionality.
- Understand how to use the SPL data structures (Maps, Heaps, Doubly Linked Lists, Fixed Size Arrays, Stacks and Queues)

The following are the Outputs, Knowledge, Behaviors, and Beliefs for PHP Data Structures.

## **Outputs**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. A comprehensive blog post on [goodheads.io](http://goodheads.io) explaining how Iterators and generators work.
2. I believe I can write more efficient PHP programs that saves memory by writing generator functions to deal with large datasets.
3. A comprehensive blog post on goodheads.io explaining how SPL data structures work.

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:**  When I want to store one or more values in a single variable... **Action:**  I will make use of arrays.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to perform operations on arrays...**Action:** I should be able to identify and use the appropriate array function that suites the operation that’s to be performed on the array.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am working with large data sets... **Action:**  I can easily save memory by using generators. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am working with a list/collection of values... **Action:** I can use Iterators to traverse the collection.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am working with Generators... **Action:** I will just assign the value to a variable and let PHP automatically detect the type. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I am working on a program that involves a collection of values... **Action:**  I can make use of Spl data structures.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am working on a program in PHP... **Action:** I will take advantage of the SPL classes and methods where necessary to aid efficiency and save development time.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
