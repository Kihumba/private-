## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to define variables or constants **Action:** I use names that are descriptive of what the variables or constants contain.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I need to run a collection of procedures that should run from top to bottom **Action:** I use functions. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have procedures to run, that depend on a certain input or value **Action:** I use a conditional expression to cater for the optional procedure to run. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have to loop through a collection of data, where some elements donâ€™t need alteration **Action:** I use break and continue to cater for such process.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I need to create, reference or manipulate data **Action:** I assign the value to a variable and let PHP automatically detect the type. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I want to perform an arithmetic operation **Action:**  I use one of the available arithmetic operators.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I write a piece of code in PHP **Action:** I ensure it follows the PSR-2 standards.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I am working a project that involves several classes and PHP files **Action:**   I ensure it follows the PSR-4 autoloading standard.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I need to retrieve the values of a GET and POST request **Action:** I use a super global variable.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to maintain state across files **Action:** I use a $_SESSION superglobal variable.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
