# Outcome 2 -  PHP Data Structures

**Skill Description**
----------

The learning outcomes expected of a fellow that has covered this module are as follows:
- Arrays and it's workings
- The different types of array available in PHP and how to traverse them using the foreach function
- Have a thorough understanding of a vast majority of the operations possible with arrays including the list function and array sort functions
- The concept of Iterators and Generators in PHP
- SPL functionality
- SPL data structures (Maps, Heaps, Doubly Linked Lists, Fixed Size Arrays, Stacks and Queues)


## **Outputs**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. A comprehensive blog post on [goodheads.io](http://goodheads.io) explaining how Iterators and generators work.
2. A comprehensive blog post on goodheads.io explaining how SPL data structures work.
