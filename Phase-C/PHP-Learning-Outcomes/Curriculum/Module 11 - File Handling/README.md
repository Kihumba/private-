# Module 11: File Handling - KBBs

**Summary:**
The learning outcomes expected of a fellow that has covered this module are as follows:
- Basic file operations and how to perform them using PHP - Create a File, Open a File, Close a File, Read a File, Write to a File, Append to a File.
- Basic directory operations using PHP - Open a Directory, Read contents within a directory, Change working directory.
- More advanced directory operations in PHP using the DirectoryIterator and RecursiveDirectoryIterator classes. Also serves as an introduction to working with SPL Iterator classes.


The following are the Outputs, Knowledge, Behaviors, and Beliefs for File Handling.


## **Outputs**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. A Simple File Manager with these features:
    a. Show the list of files in a directory
    b. Create a new file
    c. Write to a new file
    d. Delete a particular file

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When building an application with PHP.. **Action:**  I will use inbuilt functions like file_get_contents to read contents from a file.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When Interacting with directories within my PHP program.. **Action:**  I use DirectoryIterator and RecursiveDirectoryIterator classes| [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The DirectoryIterator class provides a simple interface for viewing the contents of filesystem directories. | [] | [] |
| Compared to the inbuilt file functions, The Iterator Classes provides better and fluent methods for file and directory operations  | [] | [] |
