# Outcome 5 - Object Oriented Programming in PHP

**Skill Description**

The learning outcomes expected of a fellow that has covered this module are as follows:
- Object oriented programming concepts, classes and objects.
- Concepts of Inheritance, Polymorphism and Encapsulation, among others, in PHP programming.
- The concept of Traits, Interfaces and Abstraction in PHP.
- The concept of type-hinting non-scalar and scalar values in PHP.
- The concept of Inversion of Control in PHP.
- The concept of Method overloading using __call() and __callStatic().
- PHP magic methods available to objects and their uses e.g Getters, Setters and Destructors.
- Object Serialization in PHP.

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to reuse a collection of methods, properties or attributes... **Action:**  I create an instance of a class that contains those collections when needed. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:**  When I need to create a class that needs some existing behaviors already present in another class...**Action:** I create a class that inherits these behaviors.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to access classes, function and variables... **Action:**  I import the encapsulating namespace and reference them accordingly. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The essentials of object oriented programming allows one to write well decoupled and reusable code.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| Inheritance and Abstraction are essential techniques that can be employed to avoid writing duplicated blocks of code. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Every thing in the real world can be modeled in terms of objects interacting with each other. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
