# Module 6:  Namespaces, Code Organization, and Dependency Injection

**Summary:**
Namespacing and Code Organization are key to working with PHP as an opensource community programming language. Dependency Injection in PHP simplifies code and creates flexibility in hard-coded dependencies.

## **Outputs**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to creae a PHP Program that contains at least 3 different classes that are namespaced and interact with each other.

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When writing a PHP Package that involves multiple Classes **Action:**  I namespace the classes and use the PSR-4 Autoloading Standard.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:**  When I am writing reusable code **Action:** I namespace it.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I write a PHP Package **Action:**  I upload it to Packagist using Composer to make it available for everyone. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to achieve multiple inheritance in a PHP program **Action:**  I use Traits. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to write a loosely coupled PHP program **Action:**  I make use of the Dependency Injection concept. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
