## Suggestions

### Knowledge Units

- Knowledge of the PSR-7 spec
- Correct the multiple instances of `definitin`
- Remove duplicate How to use htaccess for URL routing
- Something about web crawling(probably over-reaching);
- Correct spelling of `htacess`

### Behaviors

 - When I want to consume a 3rd part API I use a
well maintained, PSR-7 compliant client library like `Guzzle`

- Extend `Context: When I want to track a user's movement across pages in a PHP web application Action: I use Sessions and cookies.` to be less stifliing and give option of JWTs and localStorage
