# Outcome - Open Source

Skill Description
----------
The Fellow knows how to find an open source project, communicate with members of that project, join the project community, send a pull request, and determine other ways of contributing to that project. They understand the benefits to themselves and others that are created through open source work.


Output
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I will merge at least one PR to an open source project started by someone outside Andela, communicated with other contributors, and triaged an issue on that project.

## Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Whenever I use a new module/package/gem/library **Action:** I find its repo on Github| [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I find a bug or desired feature for a module I’m using:  | | |
| - **Action:** I examine the source code of the module | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I look through the issues to see if other members have mentioned this bug/feature and I comment with my own observations | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I write the change into the module and submit it upstream as a pull requests | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When reading through a project’s documentation **Action:** I report and improve areas that I find difficult to understand | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before contributing to an open source project:  | | |
| - **Action:** I examine the repository for indicators of an active community | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I consider how else I might contribute to the project, apart from writing code | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I read through and follow any contribution guidelines | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When accepting a contribution **Action:** I actively thank any new contributors for any work they put into my project| [ ] | [ ] |

| **Context:** When creating an open source project:  | | |
| - **Action:** I add contributing guidelines to make it easy for people to contribute | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I get starter code up before seeking contributors | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I add the appropriate license to the repository | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When seeking contributors for my projects **Action:** I create new issues and tag them appropriately so contributors can find work that needs to be done | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have created a useful project **Action:** I host the code on Github and tell people about it via word of mouth and social media| [ ] | [ ] |

## Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| No problem should ever have to be solved twice | [ ] | [ ] |
| Newcomers have insights that veterans do not | [ ] | [ ] |
| Open source communities are looking for people just like me to join them | [ ] | [ ] |
| I do not need anyone’s permission to make an improvement on any open source code | [ ] | [ ] |
| A small edit is just as important as a big addition to an Open source project: It's not the bits in the commit, it's the urge in the merge | [ ] | [ ] |
