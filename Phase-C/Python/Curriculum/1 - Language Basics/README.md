## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to access the prototype of a variable... **Action:** I use the `dir` function. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to find the type of variable or compare variable types... **Action:** I use the `type` function. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need a variable to store multiple values... **Action:** I use a list | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to define a block of code that executes based on a condition... **Action:** I use the `if-else` construct. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to repeat a block of code a fixed number of times... **Action:** I use the `for` loop construct. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I use a `for` loop... **Action:** I indicate the number of times I want to repeat my code block via the length of the list/generator. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to perform an operation on many items on a list... **Action:** I use a `for` loop with the list as the iterator parameter. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to repeat a block of code an indeterminate number of times... **Action:** I use the `while` loop construct. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to convert from one type to another... **Action:** I the type function syntax. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to store a collection of data in a flat structure... **Action:** I make use of lists. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to create a collection of items that I will not modify... **Action:** I make use of a tuple. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to store data as key-value pairs... **Action:** I make use of dictionaries. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to create lists on the fly from any iterable... **Action:** I make use of list comprehension syntax. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to create a collection of data that I will be performing bulk arithmetic operations on like difference, union, intersection... **Action:** I make use of a set. | [ ] | [ ] |
