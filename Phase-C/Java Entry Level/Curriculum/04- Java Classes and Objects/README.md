# Outcome 4 - Java Classes and Objects

## Skill Description
----------
A person with this skill can navigate the structure of  a Java class. They use Java classes as the blueprint for creation of Java objects, and consistently use classes, objects, and Java OOP concepts  in their Java Programming.


## Outputs
----------
- **Task:** Write a Java program solves a real world problem using classes, objects and Java OOP fundamental concepts.
- **Resources:** Include inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Overriding, interfaces and abstraction in your code. Command line & Notepad and/or your favourite IDE.
- **Include:** N/A

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Context: When I have a method that will be called on a class Action: I use a class method. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Context: When I have a variable that applies to every instance of an object in my program Action: I use an instance variable. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Context: When I have a variable that will be used only inside a single method Action: I use a local variable. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Context: When I need my method be thread-safe Action: I use the `Synchronized` keyword. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Context: After creating a class Actions: I check for (and remove) any unused imports. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Context: When creating a class Actions: I avoid adding unused variables or unnecessary methods. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Context: When I need to use the property and behaviour of a class without modifying it inside my class Actions: I use aggregation. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Context: When I need to use and modify property and behaviour of a class inside my class Actions: I use inheritance. | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Classes are the blueprints for creating Java objects. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Other developers will inherit my code, so I should name my classes and objects in a way that reflects their purpose. | [ ] | [ ]  |
