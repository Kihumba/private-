## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When declaring class variables as public static final **Action:** I ensure variable names (constants) are all in uppercase. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have a single line `if...else` statement **Action:** I used the conditional operator “? :” as a replacement. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have to make lot of modifications to a string and I care about synchronisation **Action:** I use StringBuffer. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have to make lot of modifications to a string and I don’t care about synchronisation **Action:** I use StringBuilder.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I create a String object **Action:** I do so with the knowledge that it is immutable and once created it cannot be altered. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I create an Array in Java **Action:** I always use a fixed size.  | [ ] | [ ]  |

|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Being thoroughly conversant in basic data types is absolutely necessary to becoming an expert in Java. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Java provides a rich set of operators to manipulate variables. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The basics serve as the foundation on which mighty things are built. | [ ] | [ ]  |
