# Outcome 6 - Data structures in Java 

## Skill Description
----------
A person with this skill takes full advantage of data structures to design and build efficient Java applications. By using the right data structures at the right time, he/she can search, sort, and manipulate information, all while reducing the complexity of his/her code.



## Outputs
----------
- **Task:** Map out all the data structure Legacy interfaces/classes and collection framework interfaces in Java and their use cases. Then write a simple program to demonstrate the use of each one interface/classes mentioned above.
- **Resources:** Use any medium for your mapping (infographic, blog post, etc). Use command line & Notepad or your favourite IDE for your program.
- **Include:** N/A.

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before starting to build a Java application, **Action:** I map out the data structures I will be using during development. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I need to store a unique list of items/elements, **Action:** I use `Set` rather than `List`. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I need to implement FIFO, **Action:** I use the Queue interface.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I need to store a sorted unique list of items/elements, **Action:** I use `SortedSet`.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I need to retrieve elements based on the closest match to a given value or values, **Action:** I use NavigableSet. | [ ] | [ ]  |

|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| XJava provides a powerful set of data structures that makes development seamless. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| I don’t have to reinvent the “data structure wheel”-- I can use Java’s implementation of many common algorithms. | [ ] | [ ]  |
