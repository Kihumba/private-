# Outcome 12- Essential JavaScript Design Patterns

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can work with common JavaScript design patterns when building an application. They can explain why design patterns matter, and how they are created. 

## Output
- **Task:** Using a JavaScript program you have worked on in the past, or one you are currently building, implement a design pattern that resolves a problem in it. 
- **Resources:** Use any design pattern that you deem most effective, and defend in writing why you chose to use this particular pattern.
- **Include:** N/A

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am not sure what design pattern to implement, **Action:** I start by considering the problem I am trying to solve. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am clear on what problem I am trying to solve, **Action:** I think about what the implementation will look like. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to control the object creation process, **Action:** I use the creational design pattern. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to manage relationships between objects so that one part of my application does not affect all other parts, **Action:** I use a Structural (or “singleton”( design pattern. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When my primary goal is for objects to communicate with one another, **Action:** I use a behavioral (or “observer”) design pattern. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to keep parts of my code independent from other parts, **Action:** I use a module design pattern. | [ ] | [ ] |
