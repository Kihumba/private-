# Outcome 1- Introduction to JavaScript

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can explain the history of Javascript, why it is so pervasively used in development, and what challenges it poses as a programming language. 

## Output
- **Task:** Create a blog post (or other media representation) that outlines your own definition of the pro’s and con’s of JavaScript as a programming language
- **Resources:** Feel free to get creative and use any medium that allows you to go deep and represent the many nuances of JavaScript.
- **Include:** Share your reflections with your team.

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before I dive into writing code in JavaScript, **Action:** I first understand what problems it is most effective at solving as a language. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am choosing an EMCAScript engine, **Action:**  I consider what project I am planning to build and what functionality it needs. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am outlining my code for a JavaScript program, **Action:** I use modularity to break it into different functions. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am starting a new JavaScript project, **Action:** I prefer using ES6 or later and compile down. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The benefit to the robust JavaScript community is that there are lots of modules and documentations available. The drawback is that many are meaningless or overly complex. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I can dig through the noise of the good, mediocre, and bad JavaScript documentation that exists and find the gems that answer my questions.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Because JavaScript is not easy to master, I can be one of the few in the world who really does. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| If it can be written in JavaScript, it will be written in JavaScript. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| JavaScript is the language of the web-- If I am a web developer, I cannot escape it. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Because I can’t escape JavaScript, I may as well master it. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| JavaScript does have oddities and dark corners- but if I learn how to avoid them or deal with them, it will be simple.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
