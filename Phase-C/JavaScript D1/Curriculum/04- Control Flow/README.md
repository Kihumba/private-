# Outcome 4- Control Flow

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can use control flow statements to “direct traffic” in their code, allowing it to take certain actions based on a variety of scenarios. 

## Output 
- **Task:** Create a simple JavaScript program that iterates over a loop during certain conditions, and executes an alternative function under others. 
- **Resources:** Make use of at least two types of conditional statements and an exit from the loops. 
- **Include:** N/A

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am writing JavaScript code, **Action:** I avoid over-use of loops. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I am creating a for loop, **Action:** I begin with an ‘initialization’ statement. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I want to run a function only while a specified condition is true, **Action:** I use a ‘while loop’. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When each loop iteration is complete, **Action:** I write in a ‘final-expression’ to be executed before the next condition check. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I have many options to choose from, **Action:** I use switch statements instead of chaining many ‘if else’ statements. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I create a switch statement, **Action:** I always write in a default statement. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Never use a fancy function when a simple forLoop will do - and never use a for loop where a map, reduce or filter can be used. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
