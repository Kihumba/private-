## Objective 2- Basic JavaScript Syntax

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can write and run basic JavaScript commands in the console.  They adhere to Javascript syntax conventions, and comment their code to clarify the purpose of each line. 

## Output
- **Task:** Create a simple JavaScript app that runs in the console, and which solves a real world problem. 
- **Resources:** Use the console in your browser to play with basic JavaScript commands to get a feel for the syntax. 
- **Include:** N/A

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am writing some code in Javascript, **Action:** I add comments regularly to clarify the purpose of each piece of my program.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am writing a JavaScript program, I check my assumptions as I go, rather than waiting for a debugging phase. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am writing a JavaScript application, **Action:** I check the console periodically using the REPL loop. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When something goes wrong in my JavaScript code, **Action:** I resist the urge to throw in a bunch of console logs. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**When something goes wrong in my code, **Action:** I break it down into small expressions and check the browser to find the error. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am writing a new JavaScript progra`m, **Action:** I first get a functional script running without worrying too much about how “clean” it is.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have a script running, **Action:** I then optimize it for performance. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** Before committing any code, **Action:** I make sure that I’m not blocking the main thread in any way. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want a variable to be accessible to any other code in my program, **Action:** I create a global variable. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want a variable available only within one function, **Action:** I declare a local variable within that function. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am initializing a variable, **Action:** I use the assignment operator to it them a value. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am naming a variable, **Action:** I pay attention to whether I am using upper-case or lower-case letters to be compatible with JavaScript’s case-sensitivity. 
| **Context:** When I am structuring my JavaScript Code, **Action:** I do not use shorthand-- I add curly braces and semi-colons. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| JavaScript’s syntax makes it both compact and flexible. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| The smaller I break down my code and the more I check the console, the better I understand any problems that arise. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| My code is written for the computer, but also for other programmers-- Good comments communicate the intent of my code.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Any amount of milliseconds of processing time adds friction to my application, and is a cost to be considered.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| JavaScript is simple and pervasive-- I could call a friend and they could open up their browser to get started exploring JavaScript without installing anything!  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| JavaScript can get really ugly, really fast-- but I can minimize this by creating thoughtful code from the start. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I don’t block the main thread, ever! |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
