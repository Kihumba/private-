# Outcome 18 - Functional Programming in JavaScript

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can write code using functions as building blocks. They can break down complex problems into subproblems solvable using smaller, simpler functions and can combine the smaller functions to solve the bigger problem.

## Output
- **Task:** Take a previous JavaScript program you’ve worked on, and refactor it using Functional Programming methods. 
- **Resources:** Reflect on the changes in writing-- how does the code look different? How efficient is it? 
- **Include:** N/A

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am writing JavaScript code, **Action:** I break down my code into small, composable functions. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have a function that expects multiple parameters, **Action:** I curry it.
| **Context:** When writing JavaScript functions, **Action:** I ensure my functions are pure and referentially transparent. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When writing JavaScript code, **Action:** I use inbuilt functions that avoid mutating data. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I’m writing higher order functions that manipulate data, **Action:** I pass in the data last to enhance composability.
| **Context:** When I have to manipulate data in JavaScript, **Action:** I use collection-iteration functions such as `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `some`, `every`, or `find` instead of using `for loops`. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need impure functionality in my code, **Action:** I write pure wrappers around the impure functionality. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |

Belief
| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Functional programming helps me write code that is simple and expressive. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Functional programming results in code that is easy to understand, reuse, test, refactor, maintain, and reason about. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Functional programming does require discipline to write, but it is well worth it.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
