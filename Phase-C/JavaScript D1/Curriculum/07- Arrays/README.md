# Outcome 7- Arrays 

## Skill Description
A person with this skill uses arrays to store, access, and manipulate elements in their JavaScript program. They appropriately make use of nested arrays, and iterate over arrays with the most efficient code possible. 

## Output
- **Task:** Write a JavaScript program that stores a list of something and that models a real-world problem (for example, a list of users, goods, HTML elements, etc). 
- **Resources:** Use arrays to create the ordered collections of elements necessary. 
- **Include:** N/A

## Behavior

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to store multiple values in one variable, **Action:** I use an array. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am dealing with a list of objects that I want in a specific order, **Action:** I use an array. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to access or modify array data, **Action:** I use indexes. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to store data that will be constantly updated, **Action:** I prefer using an object with id keys over using an array. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want delete an index in my array, **Action:** I use `Array.prototype.slice` rather than `delete`. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |

## Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Unlike arrays in many other languages, JavaScript arrays are objects, and that completely changes how I should think about working with them. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
