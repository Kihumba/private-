# Outcome 6 - Django Views

**Skill Description**
----------
 A Django View is simply a Python function that takes a Web request and returns a Web response. There are many different types of views including Function-Based Views, Class-Based Views, Sessions, Forms, and Authentication.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create a Django application that uses views to authenticate users and perform validation.

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to create a route that points to a view function **Action:** I import the view function into the routes file and pass it as the `view` parameter of the `url()` function. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to communicate with my database within the view **Action:** I import the models I need within the view file to enable me perform queries. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to set data I want to persist for just the next request **Action:** I set the message as a flash message. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am setting flash messages **Action:** I take advantage of message context to make it easier to display messages in the proper format within my view. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I validate multiple data fields at once **Action:** I make use of Django forms. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I create a form to use to validate my data **Action:** I carefully specify each field that I'm expecting from the user using the appropriate data types provided by the Forms framework. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to create a form that is linked to my model **Action:** I make use of ModelForms to make the process easier. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When creating a form **Action:** I specify custom validation logic within the form class. | [ ] | [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I have full control of what my users experience within my Django views. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The more robust my logic is the more satisfied my users are. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Django provides most of what I need to be a successful web developer. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| I use higher level abstractions when working with Views and Forms in Django because it mimics common actions I would perform as a developer. | [ ] | [ ]  |
