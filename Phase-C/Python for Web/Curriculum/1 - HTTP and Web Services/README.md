# Outcome 1 - HTTP and Web Services

**Skill Description**
----------
On order to use Python when developing for the web, the Fellow must first show complete understanding of HTTP and Web services. This includes various components, including HTTP protocol, REST, and consuming APIs.

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to build an app that consumes an API using the `requests` library.

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When working with an API **Action:** I always read the documentation extensively to get familiar with the different endpoints and corresponding parameters. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When testing with an API **Action:** I make use of [POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com/) or [Httpie](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie). | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making an HTTP request **Action:** I specify the resource I am trying to access using the URL. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have gotten a response from an HTTP request that I made **Action:** I always inspect the response status code and message to get adequate situational information. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making an HTTP request to a RESTful API **Action:** I indicate the function I'm trying to access via the corresponding HTTP verbs.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making an HTTP `GET` request **Action:** I specify parameters within the URI (after the question mark). | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making an HTTP `GET` request **Action:** I separate multiple `GET` parameters using the `&` sign. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making an HTTP `POST` or `PUT` request to a RESTful API **Action:** I specify parameters within the request body. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making an HTTP request **Action:** I define the operating parameters of the HTTP transaction within the header of the request | [ ] | [ ] |

| Before diving into the specifics of a programming language I must first understand its interactions with the surrounding web environment. | [ ] | [ ]  |
