## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When working with an API... **Action:** I always read the documentation extensively to get familiar with the different endpoints and corresponding parameters. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When testing with an API... **Action:** I make use of [POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com/) or [Httpie](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie). | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making an HTTP request... **Action:** I specify the resource I'm trying to access using the URL. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have gotten a response from an HTTP request that I made... **Action:** I always inspect the response status code and message to get adequate situational information. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making an HTTP request to a RESTful API... **Action:** I indicate the function I'm trying to access via the corresponding HTTP verbs.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making an HTTP `GET` request... **Action:** I specify parameters within the URI (after the question mark). | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making an HTTP `GET` request... **Action:** I separate multiple `GET` parameters using the `&` sign. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making an HTTP `POST` or `PUT` request to a RESTful API... **Action:** I specify parameters within the request body. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making an HTTP request... **Action:** I define the operating parameters of the HTTP transaction within the header of the request | [ ] | [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| APIs exist to give me access to data and functionality from 3rd Party service providers. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| HTTP status codes exist to give me information about the type of errors that occur while trying to consume the API. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Multiple clients can be built on different platforms (mobile, desktop, embedded system) to consume data and functionality via an HTTP API on a single server. | [ ] | [ ]  |
