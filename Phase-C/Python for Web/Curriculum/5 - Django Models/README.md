# Outcome 5 - Django Models

**Skill Description**
----------
Django Models contain the essential fields and behaviors of the data you're storing. A model will generally map to a single database table. 


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to model a database using the Django Model ORM to implement relationships, and create a Django Admin interface for working with the models.

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to start working on an application **Action:** I ensure to model my data in an extremely detailed manner before I begin coding. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When defining a Django model **Action:** I use the appropriate model field types available in Django. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When defining a Django model **Action:** I define all reusable logic that has to do with the models within the model class. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to create model relationships **Action:** I use one of the relationships classes or `ForeignKey()` to define the relationship. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to query my database **Action:** I use Django's Model ORM functions. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to access a model's related child objects **Action:** I use the `related_set` syntax. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to make complex queries beyond what the `filter` syntax provides **Action:** I use the `Q` function. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to make complex queries beyond what Django's ORM provides **Action:** I use raw SQL queries using the `raw` function. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to create automated actions that execute for specific database operations **Action:** I create a receiver function to respond to the signal triggered by the database operation. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After I've created my data models **Action:** I configure my DjangoAdmin to enable me easily access and manipulate data objects. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I try to access DjangoAdmin **Action:** I create superuser account using `manage.py createsuperuser` command | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am configuring DjangoAdmin **Action:** I register all the models I would like to have access to on the Admin site in `admin.py`. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am configuring DjangoAdmin **Action:** I ensure that I am as detailed as possible to give me optimal control for the data objects from the interface. | [ ] | [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| A little care in setting up my data model goes a long way. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Django Admin gives me optimal control of my database records. | [ ] | [ ]  |
