# Outcome 7- Event Loop

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can use event loop in both Node and in the browser to improve their programâ€™s speed and allow for concurrency and asynchronicity in their program. 

## Output
Task: Create a JavaScript program that takes in User Interaction in the form of several simultaneous signals 
Resources: Use event loop to asynchronously run your callbacks in the background
Include: N/A

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to allow for asynchronous callbacks, **Action:** I use event loop.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to defer a callback until the stack is clear, **Action:** I set runtime to zero.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to optimize runtime, **Action:** I implement concurrency.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to add events to a the queue for processing, **Action:** I call `setTimeout` to add a message that will run as a second argument if the event cannot be processed right away.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The event loop transforms JavaScript from a one-thread slow-moving ogre to a lighting fast multi-tasking wizard.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Event Loop is simple-- but it allows for complexity in your program.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
