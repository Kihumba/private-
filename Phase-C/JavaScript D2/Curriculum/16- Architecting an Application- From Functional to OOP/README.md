# Outcome 16- Architecting an Application: From Functional to Object Oriented Programming

## Skill Description
A person with this skill writes idiomatic, clear, object oriented JavaScript code that is easy to build onto. 

## Output 
- **Build:** Take an application that you have been programming functionally and outline how you would re-write it in an Object Oriented Style. 
- **Feedback:** Reflect on the changes, and decide which version is more practical. Write a short explanation of why this is. 
- **Iterate:** If you decided your application would be more effective in OOP, refactor it. If not, practice OOP JavaScript by building a simple CRUD application.

| **Context:** When I am writing a JavaScript application, **Action:** I consider whether the framework I am using is better suited to Object Oriented or Functional programming.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am choosing between OOP and Functional programming in JS, **Action:** I consider the bundle size, performance needs, and debugging tradeoffs.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| A good developer writes code for a computer. A great developer writes code for other developers.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| My code does not exist in a vacuum-- I must prepare it so that other developers can work on it in the future.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Writing clean, idiomatic code is the only way to make my program immortal.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] | 
| Object Oriented programming is more readable, while Functional Programming is easier to debug.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
