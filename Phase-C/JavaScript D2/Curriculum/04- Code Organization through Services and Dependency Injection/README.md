# Outcome 4- AngularJS- Code Organization through Services and Dependency Injection

## Skill Description
A person with this skill uses dependency injection and services to refactor their AngularJS code so it is minified, clean, and readable.

## Output
- **Task:** Refactor an existing piece of AngularJS code that you or a colleague have been working on to make it as minified and clean as possible. 
- **Resources:** Use services and dependency injection to refactor and minify your code.
- **Include:** Provide both versions of your code to a teammate and request feedback on the relative readability of each if they were to jump in and start working with the code.

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I minify code in my Angular app, **Action:** I make sure dependency injections can still find their functions by providing the names of the objects to inject as strings.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I create a new service in Angular 2, **Action:** I must first import `injectable`.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to be able to reuse an object or function as a parameter throughout the rest of my code, **Action:** I create a service.  | [ ] | [ ] |
