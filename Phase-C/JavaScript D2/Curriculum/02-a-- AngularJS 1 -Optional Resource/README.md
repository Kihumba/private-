# Outcome 2a- AngularJS 1 Syntax (Optional Resource)
A person with this skill can explain what makes AngularJS powerful, when it is the best library to use, and what drawbacks it might have. They can write a simple application in AngularJS 1 syntax. 

## Output
- **Task:** Build a simple, one page application with multiple views and at least two custom filters. 
- **Resources:** Use AngularJS 1 (only if required in an existing codebase, otherwise opt for Angular 2)
- **Include:** N/A

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I first create an application, **Action:** I set up the initial state for my $scope. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to add a behavior to my scope object, **Action:** I attach a method. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am adding variables to my AngularJS code, **Action:**  I use isolated scopes whenever possible to avoid unwanted complexity. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to perform business logic, **Action:** I use a controller rather than a function assigned to $rootScope. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| $rootScope should be kept as untouched as possible-- a well designed app shouldn’t need to use it. | [ ] | [ ] |
| If I’m not careful in my scoping, a simple collection of functionality becomes an impossible tangle of inherited scopes. | [ ] | [ ] |
