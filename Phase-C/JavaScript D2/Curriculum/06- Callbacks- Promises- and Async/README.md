# Outcome 6- Callbacks, Promises, and Async

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can describe what is meant by asynchronous programming in JavaScript and how it makes JavaScript powerful. All these tools provide a way to deal with “deferred work” in their program.


## Output
- **Task:** Create a simple JavaScript program that runs a task asynchronously in the background.
- **Resources:** Use promises (and/or conditionals)
- **Include:** n/a

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want my program to be able to run a function at some point in the future, I use callbacks. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need my program to run as quickly as possible for multiple functions, **Action:** I consider how i could use asynchronous programming to do so. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When any part of a function or method is asynchronous, **Action:** I make all parts of it asynchronous. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am writing code meant to be run asynchronously, **Action:** I consider using `async await` to make the code easier to read. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to ensure that my program is never blocking an action that needs to execute, **Action:** I use asynchronous programming as a default. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have two functions listening for the same method, **Action:** I order them carefully, knowing that the one that is registered first will be run first. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to call multiple functions sequentially, **Action:** I use promises. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have nested callbacks, **Action:** I use promises to simplify and “flatten out” my code. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| If you understand asynchronous programming in JavaScript, you can do **anything**. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Asynchronous thinking is an inversion of the linear way we normally think-- but if you can start thinking that way in your JavaScript programming, the world is your oyster. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Promises are difficult-- but they are not impossible. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Clean, simple code is faster, more powerful, and easier to test. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Promises and asynchronous programming provide a cleaner way to program in JavaScript. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| If I overuse callbacks, I can create an impossible tangle of Callback Hell. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
