# Outcome 11-  Intro to React

## Skill Description
A person with this skill is comfortable creating a basic program in React. They can explain what makes React a powerful framework for JavaScript, what problems it solves well, and what drawbacks it has. 

## Output
- **Task:** Build an API for something (ex. Restaurant reservation system). Think through: what will be your endpoints? What will they interact with? What data structures would you use?
- **Tools:** Use React JS for your routing. You can choose if you’d like to use another React tool such as Flux as well.
- **Include:** N/A

## Alternative output
- **Task:** Build a React program using one component for a table, then refactor it so it has a component per row
- **Resources:** Note the differences in complexity of event handling. 
- **Include:** N/A

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am building a React application, **Action:** I start with the big picture, then break down my site into smaller pieces or components. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am “thinking in React,” **Action:**  I first break the UI of my project into components and subcomponents. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am determining what aspects of an application should be in each component, **Action:** I use the single responsibility principle. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am building an application in React, **Action:** I start with a static version using props. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have a static version of my React app, **Action:** I identify the states and where they should live. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have an app that renders correctly as a function of props and states, **Action:** I add in data flow to allow for user interaction. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When things are getting complicated in React, **Action:** I consider if I could break things into smaller pieces. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** If I notice that I have closures inside a component, **Action:** I am doing too much in one place, and break them up. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I write a component in React, **Action:** I check to make sure that it is only affecting one change in my program. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** If I have to do a ton of work to understand what some code should do with an event, **Action:** I need to refactor to make my component more specific. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I realize I am using a Closure in React, **Action:** I consider adding more components to handle the events simply instead. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| React allows me to break down my app into small pieces that can be reused, moved around, and easily understood-- like building with many lego bricks. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| React is mainly a concept, and a library just secondarily. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| There is no such thing as building a component that it too small. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| In React, I should be doing only one very simple thing in one place. |   [ ]   |   [ ] | 
| To be a powerful programmer in React, you just have to think in the same organization patterns that React uses. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
