## The Andela Learning Map

> "Learning is the new skill. Imagination, creation, and asking new questions are at its core." - Sugata Mitra

### The Purpose of the Andela Curriculum
The Andela Curriculum is a platform that offers **motivating inspiration**, **guiding resources**, and opportunities for **pragmatic practice**. 

It uses learning science to enable learners uplevel their technology and team skills so they can progress towards new roles, new skills, and new opportunities to change the world. 

### How to Use the Curriculum
As you grow at Andela, use this curriculum to help you guide your learning by building Outputs that give you real-world practice and KBB's that accelerate your insight into how experts think about these skills. If you get stuck, reference one of the related resources attached to the curriculum, or reach out to an expert on the experts page (coming soon). 

As you learn, make sure you also contribute-- even as a beginner, you are an invaluable expert with your ["beginner's mind"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin) (sometimes even more so than someone who has been doing the tasks for a long time). The curriculum exists because of you-- submit pull requests or [Slack #ask-learning](https://andela.slack.com/messages/ask-learning).

The curriculum is carefully structured around four phases of learning: 
1. **Conceptual Learning** 
2. **Applied Work** 
3. **Knowledge Sharing** 
4. **Purposeful Reflection**

>> - **Conceptual Learning:** Use the `Resources`, `Knowledge Units`, and `Beliefs` gathered from experts to dive into the new material on a conceptual level. 
>> - **Applied Work:** Work is not the end result of learning, it is the _means of learning in itself._ Use the `Outputs` and `Behaviors` to get your hands dirty, really start learning, and have something to show for it! 
>> - **Knowledge Sharing:** As a developer, you will always be working on a team. Share your knowledge through mentorship, collaboration on outputs, and [contributions to the learning map](https://docs.google.com/a/andela.com/forms/d/1LyMSebi90YnUxj5G6UD4eGGsItjb3XjgeAAWHpQZYkQ/edit) itself! Sharing knowledge is critical to your success as a developer _and_ as a learner... 
>> - **Purposeful Reflection:** Learning Paths will contain several "Refactoring" and/or "Reflecting" outputs-- _don't skip these!_ It may seem like "extra" work, but science shows that it is the **#1 most effective** way to solidify new knowledge. Try it... see what happens!
