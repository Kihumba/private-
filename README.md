## The Andela Learning Map

> "Learning is the new skill. Imagination, creation, and asking new questions are at its core." - Sugata Mitra

### The Purpose of the Andela Curriculum
The Andela Curriculum is a platform that offers **motivating inspiration**, **guiding resources**, and opportunities for **pragmatic practice**. 

It uses learning science to enable learners uplevel their technology and team skills so they can progress towards new roles, new skills, and new opportunities to change the world. 

### How to Use the Curriculum
The curriculum is carefully structured around four phases of learning: 
1. **Conceptual Learning** 
2. **Applied Work** 
3. **Knowledge Sharing** 
4. **Purposeful Reflection**

</p>

>> - **Conceptual Learning:** Use the `Resources`, `Knowledge Units`, and `Beliefs` gathered from experts to dive into the new material on a conceptual level. 
>> - **Applied Work:** Work is not the end result of learning, it is the _means of learning in itself._ Use the `Outputs` and `Behaviors` to get your hands dirty, really start learning, and have something to show for it! 
>> - **Knowledge Sharing:** As a developer, you will always be working on a team. Share your knowledge through mentorship, collaboration on outputs, and [contributions to the learning map](https://docs.google.com/a/andela.com/forms/d/1LyMSebi90YnUxj5G6UD4eGGsItjb3XjgeAAWHpQZYkQ/edit) itself! Sharing knowledge is critical to your success as a developer _and_ as a learner... 
>> - **Purposeful Reflection:** Learning Paths will contain several "Refactoring" and/or "Reflecting" outputs-- _don't skip these!_ It may seem like "extra" work, but science shows that it is the **#1 most effective** way to solidify new knowledge. Try it... see what happens!
