# How to use the Required Skills Section

In this section you will find the required skills to advance to a Software Architect Role at Andela, broken down into 4 categories: 
1. Leadership & Communication
2. Technical Knowledge
3. Business Domain Knowledge
4. Methodology and Strategy

Each category is split into tables of three: 
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th align="center"> Skill / Attribute </th>
      <th align="center">Developed By (resources) </th>
      <th align="center">Demonstrated By (output) </th>
    </tr>
    </tbody> 
</table> 

The skill in question is demonstrated by completing an *output* (either in the interview or beforehand) and is supported by *resources* to help you develop that skill or move closer to completing that output.
