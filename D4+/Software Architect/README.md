# Software Architect Growth Path

The **Software Architect** Growth Path at Andela is designed to allow experienced Developers to have real-world opportunities to work on the interactions of complex systems. This path is not a Client Placement Track: instead, it is designed to allow Fellows to build experience and skills that will move them toward becoming a Software Architect in the future _through_ Client and Andela work. 

A Software Architect's role is both business-related and technical. Their purpose is to translate business needs into technical solutions, and to guide that solutionâ€™s tactical & strategic evolution. By gaining a broad _and_ deep understanding of how different parts of a technology system interact, Software Architects are also well positioned to become CTO's, Enterprise Product Leaders, and Entrepreneurs in the future.

**Expert Note:**
The key to being an excellent Software Architect is not necessarily to be an _expert programmer_ in a particular stack. The most important skills are computer science knowledge, and a deep understanding of how all parts of a system fit together.
