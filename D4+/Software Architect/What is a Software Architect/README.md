# The Software Architect Role

A Software Architect's role is both business-related and technical. Their purpose is to translate business needs into technical solutions, and to guide that solutionâ€™s tactical & strategic evolution.

**Expert Note:**
The key to being an excellent Software Architect is not necessarily to be an _expert programmer_ in a particular stack. The most important skills are computer science knowledge, and a deep understanding of how all parts of a system fit together.
