# Output 06- Create an Analysis Model Using Statecharts

- **The Product:** When architecting a system, it is important to be able to clarify different states of an object/product/program during its lifespan. Statecharts are a tool that Systems Analysts use to precisely model the behavior of complex, reactive systems. Walk through a product and determine its use cases, percepts, and interactions from internal and external stimuli. Create a statechart diagram that models the percepts and states of your product. 
- **The Process:** If you’d like, you can use the Clock Radio example in Udacity’s SA course as a starting point (Lesson 13), but also try to come up with your own (from Andela, a client, or another source). 
- **The Follow-Through:** Make sure to sit down with your client before, during, and after your Statechart building process- before, to make sure you got all the requirements; during to ask questions as you build your UML, and after to verify your diagram.

| **Behaviors** 	| 
|  **Context:** When I am setting up a Statechart model, **Action:** I first determine usage scenarios and external percepts.	|  
| **Context:** When I have determined percepts, **Action:** I model them with states. |
| **Context:** When I have modeled my states and external controls, **Action:** I add in a list of stimulus/response(s) pairs and coordination mechanisms. |  
| **Context:** When I have completed my statechart, **Action:** I validate the resulting statechart through review, modelchecking, or a simulator. |
