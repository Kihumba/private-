# Output 03- Re-Architect a Product

- **The Product:** Using either Andela or your current client as the example, choose a product that you might want to re-architect. Does the application supply the desired benefits currently? Are they doing so efficiently and scalably? Why or why not? What systems do they interact with? Describe the infrastructure dependencies of that application, and how you would re-architect that system in its next generation to accommodate future technology change at the organization. 
- **The Process:** Start with the current system to make sure you understand its intricacies and appreciate how it got to where it is. Diagram the existing system and the changes proposed to it to include in both your proposal document and your final presentation. Develop a proposal document, technical diagram, and/or pitch deck that describes the change, why it is necessary, what steps will need to be taken to achieve it, and what the current and future results of the reform will be.
- **The Follow-Through:**  Pitch this to appropriate parties for feedback (and maybe even implementation!)

| **"KBB's"** <br> _What do experts think, do, and feel as they work through this task?_|
|----------|
| </br>| 
| **Knowledge**	| 
| How to assess business technology architecture for: |
| - Performance |
| - Scalability |
| - Extensibility |
| Definition of a Quality of Service (QoS) and why it matters for distributed infrastructure |
| </br> | 
| **Behaviors** 	| 
|  **Context:** When I am assessing my businessâ€™s technology infrastructure, **Action:** I start by looking at the programming languages used. 	|  
| **Context:** Once I know what programming languages are used, **Action:** I examine the training requirements each developer must have. |
| **Context:** When I am assessing QoS architectural requirements, **Action:** I ask questions about the reliability, security, and continuity of service to drive my infrastructure recommendations.  |  
| **Context:** When I am assessing my business, **Action:** I ensure that our technology meets our needs both for now and the for the future (performance, scalability, extensibility). |  
| </br> | 
| **Beliefs**	| 
|A good infrastructure works both now and in the future-- it will grow with my business. |
