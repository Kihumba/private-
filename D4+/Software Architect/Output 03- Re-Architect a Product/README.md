# Output 03- Re-Architect a Product

- **The Product:** Using either Andela or your current client as the example, choose a product that you might want to re-architect. Does the application supply the desired benefits currently? Are they doing so efficiently and scalably? Why or why not? What systems do they interact with? Describe the infrastructure dependencies of that application, and how you would re-architect that system in its next generation to accommodate future technology change at the organization. 
- **The Process:** Start with the current system to make sure you understand its intricacies and appreciate how it got to where it is. Diagram the existing system and the changes proposed to it to include in both your proposal document and your final presentation. Develop a proposal document, technical diagram, and/or pitch deck that describes the change, why it is necessary, what steps will need to be taken to achieve it, and what the current and future results of the reform will be.
- **The Follow-Through:**  Pitch this to appropriate parties for feedback (and maybe even implementation!)
