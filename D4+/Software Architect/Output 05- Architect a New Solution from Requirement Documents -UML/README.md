# Output 05- Architect a New Solution from Requirement Documents (UML)

- **The Product:** This is the SA’s dream-- a blank page on which to architect a new solution from a simple set of Business Requirements. Source a Business Requirement Document, identify your stakeholders, and use UML to create a class diagram representing your solution’s architecture. <br>
- **The Process:**  If you’d like, you can use the Library example in Udacity’s SA course as a starting point (Lesson 8), but also try to come up with your own (from Andela, a client, or another source).  <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** Make sure to sit down with your client before, during, and after your Class Diagram building process- before, to make sure you got all the requirements; during to ask questions as you build your UML, and after to verify your diagram.
