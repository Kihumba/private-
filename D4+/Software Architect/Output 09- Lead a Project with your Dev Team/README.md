# Output 09- Lead a Project with your Dev Team

- **The Product:** As a Software Architect, you will be a leader for your team and will act in a supervisory role during development construction to ensure that the original vision is understood and executed. In some cases, you will be working with a Technical Team Lead, a Product Manager, a Project Manager, or other roles to share leadership responsibilities. Your focus is to act as the glue for all the moving parts that will help create your system architecture vision.
- **The Process:** Lead a dev team through one of your projects-- either one you have already worked on or a new project. Remember that you are the liaison between the business and your development team and are responsible for keeping the team on track with the project requirements AND overall business needs. For your developers, you must act as mentor, leader, code reviewer, test engineer lead, IT leadâ€¦ all in one! 
- **The Follow-Through:** As changes occur, your job is also to review change requests, analyze problems, and design iterations and accepted changes. When changes do occur, assess the impact on overall design and cost, sequence the changes in your documentation, and communicate the changes to all appropriate stakeholders.
