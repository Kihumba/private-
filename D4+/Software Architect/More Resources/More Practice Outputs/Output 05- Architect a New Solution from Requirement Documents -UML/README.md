# Output 05- Architect a New Solution from Requirement Documents (UML)

- **The Product:** This is the SA’s dream-- a blank page on which to architect a new solution from a simple set of Business Requirements. Source a Business Requirement Document, identify your stakeholders, and use UML to create a class diagram representing your solution’s architecture. <br>
- **The Process:**  If you’d like, you can use the Library example in Udacity’s SA course as a starting point (Lesson 8), but also try to come up with your own (from Andela, a client, or another source).  <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** Make sure to sit down with your client before, during, and after your Class Diagram building process- before, to make sure you got all the requirements; during to ask questions as you build your UML, and after to verify your diagram.

| **"KBB's"** <br> _What do experts think, do, and feel as they work through this task?_|
|----------|
| </br>| 
| **Knowledge**	| 
| Definition of UML and how to use it |
| How to analyze a requirements document |
| How and why to create a class Diagram |
| Distinction between Structure Diagrams, Behavior Diagrams, and Interaction Diagrams, and when to use each |
| </br> | 
| **Behaviors** 	| 
|  **Context:** When I am first reading over a requirements document, **Action:** I identify/underline the nouns in the requirements to identify the relevant elements. |  
| **Context:** After I have the relevant elements identified, **Action:** I create a class diagram that translates them into classes, values, and attributes. |
| **Context:** When I have created a class diagram, **Action:** I add in operations and relationships between them. |  
| **Context:** After I have a completed diagram, **Action:** I always verify with my product stakeholders and/or users. |  
| </br> | 
| **Beliefs**	| 
| A good BRD includes both the particular product requirements and the more macro business goals to be supported. |
