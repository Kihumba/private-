# Output 08- Pitch your Solution

- **The Product:** As a Systems Architect, you will always need to be “selling” your solution. Sometimes you might be informally selling it to your development team by explaining its technical advantages, other times you may be brought to your company’s leadership or even to a client to explain why your system is the most effective one for the business requirements. Create a pitch deck that explains the business requirements and how your solution can help. 
- **The Process:** Make sure you include both technical aspects (through diagrams, explanations, etc), business requirements and impacts, and the strategic thought behind the technical direction of the product. 
- **The Follow-Through:** Pitch your proposed solution to your team and to your stakeholders. Record yourself doing the pitch, and take time to reflect after it is completed-- what did you do well during your pitch? Where could your storytelling improve? What do the questions asked reveal about the way you explained your reasoning and technical components?
