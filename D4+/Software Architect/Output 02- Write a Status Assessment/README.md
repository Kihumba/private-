# Output 02- Write a Status Assessment

- **The Product:** Using either Andela or your current client as the example, assess the state of the business with respect to the adoption of software paradigms. Prepare a short status assessment document containing recommendations for resolving any gaps in the current technology base. <br>
- **The Process:** Look at the business goals and projections, the current internal technology and infrastructure, and the “quality of service” requirements for the infrastructures within your organization. Are there any qualities of service that could be usefully added? Will your infrastructure need to change to continue to scale? What distributed technologies would be applicable to meet these needs? <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** If you have an excellent assessment, skip to Output 7 and create a pitch deck to pitch your changes to the organization. As a Software Architect, you’ll constantly be selling architecture both internally and externally, so even if your organization doesn’t adopt this particular idea, it is always valuable to practice.

|  **Context:** When I am assessing my business’s technology infrastructure, **Action:** I start by looking at the programming languages used.	|  
| **Context:** Once I know what programming languages are used, **Action:** I examine the training requirements each developer must have |
| **Context:** When I am assessing QoS architectural requirements, **Action:** I ask questions about the reliability, 
security, and continuity of service to drive my infrastructure recommendations. |  
| **Context:** When I am assessing my business, **Action:** I ensure that our technology meets our needs both for now and the for the future (performance, scalability, extensibility). |
