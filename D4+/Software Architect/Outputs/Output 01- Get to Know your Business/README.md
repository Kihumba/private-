# Output 01- Get to Know your Business

- **The Product:** As a Software Architect, you will be the liaison between the business needs and technological requirements at your company (or for your company’s clients). At the start of any engagement, you should get a strategic view of where your business is going, and how technology will be used to achieve that vision. Spend time talking to people in every department at your company, read all the department blogs, and learn as much as you can about your organization. Many companies will have “Business Strategy” documents 
- **The Process:** Write up your own document or diagram that helps you visualize both the “macro” and “micro” visions of your organization and product. Include your various stakeholders and where they fit into your work. In this document, include the risks you foresee and how you plan to mitigate them. 
- **The Follow-Through:** Share this document with others in the organization for feedback-- they will be able to fill in the gaps you’ve missed, and might even get a lot of value from seeing the document written out this way!
