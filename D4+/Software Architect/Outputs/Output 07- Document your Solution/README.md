# Output 07- Document your Solution

- **The Product:** A Systems Architect must document a system in a way that the people who will actually construct that system will be able to use and understand. Depending on complexity of the project and if there is also a PM, documents required may differ. Could include: 
	- Class Diagrams, Statecharts, and other UML 
	- Construction Guide
	- User Interface Style Guide
	- Test Guide
	- Roadmap (if no PM) 
	- PRD (if no PM)
- **The Process:**  Include the construction process, roles of the team members on the development team, the system architecture, and construction sequences. Specify the tools and methods to be used by your team as well.  <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** Design is never linear-- seek out feedback on these documents from your stakeholders and your development team. Use a the “circular method” of design, where you are the architect and hold understanding the domain, but you also listen to the client's/team’s needs and expectations, complete necessary process changes and engineering updates, and work toward a shared vision with continuous feedback.

| **"KBB's"** <br> _What do experts think, do, and feel as they work through this task?_|
|----------|
| </br>| 
| **Knowledge**	| 
| How to communicate complex technical ideas to both technical and nontechnical audiences |
| How to earn trust with team and stakeholders using the Four-Step Trust Framework:  |
| - Offer something Valuable |
| - Request something Valuable |
| - Always follow up |
| - Always write it down |
| How to decide on the most important drivers to justify my software architecture approach |
| How to translate business requirements into System Requirements into Technical Requirements |
| </br> | 
| **Behaviors** 	| 
|  **Context:** When I am designing a system, **Action:** I always document the thinking behind the key drivers that justify my approach.	|  
| **Context:** When I am documenting a system, **Action:** I strive for 100% coverage-- any question about product, process, reasoning, or responsibility should be covered in my documents.  |
| **Context:** When I am documenting a system or project, **Action:** I get feedback from all stakeholders and my development team, and plan to iterate constantly.|  
| </br> | 
| **Beliefs**	| 
| A system or solution must be robust, effective, and maintainable/extensible. |  
| Design (of both product and process) is not linear-- it is inherently collaborative and iterative, and we should not just accept constant change but expect it. |  
| An architecture created by one person will be limited to what one person can think of, but if I keep my mind open about criticism and treat it as constructive my architecture can be far more effective.  |
