## What is a Growth Path? 

`Growth Paths` are a Fellow-inspired addition to the Andela Learning Map. These Paths provide structured work outputs, resources, and networks to help Andelans work toward their future aspirations. 

`Growth Paths` are _not_ Client Placement tracks, but they are focused aroud **real** work outputs and opportunities to level up. Every growth path includes concrete opportunities to participate in internal and external projects with real stakeholders. 

In order to get the most use out of these paths, be sure to share your work products on appropriate mediums to showcase your work and advocate for your own development of expertise. Some of these mediums include: 

- Fellow Project Showcase *(Submit a Pull Request in the Folder here!)*
- LinkedIn
- Personal Websites
- GitHub Profiles
- Subject-Specific Websites (Behance--> Design; Kaggle--> Data Science; HackerOne--> Cyber Security)
- Pitches to Stakeholders (internal or external)
- Blog posts

## Why Outputs? 
Creating real work is the best way to learn a new skill-- gone are the days where we go into a classroom and study, then emerge to try to apply what we learned from our books and lectures. **Work IS Learning**. Not only that, having an Output-Oriented path ensures that you are building relationships with real stakeholders who will be able to vouch for your work, and creating artifacts that you can showcase to advocate for your own abilities and growing expertise.

## How to Use these Paths? 
Andela `Growth Paths` are only as valuable as **you** can help us make them. Please take the following actions to ensure that these paths allow all Andelans (current and future) to move toward their dreams and transform themselves, Andela, and the world. 

1. When you complete a Work Output on a Growth Path, submit a pull request to the folder entitled "Fellow Project Showcase." This is a great way to **get noticed**, **showcase yourself as a leader and mentor**, **advocate for your own growth and experience**, and **inspire others** who may be working toward a similar goal. 
2. Use the [Curriculum Contribution Form](https://docs.google.com/a/andela.com/forms/d/1LyMSebi90YnUxj5G6UD4eGGsItjb3XjgeAAWHpQZYkQ/edit) to suggest a KBB or Work Output that you have done that is **not** yet included in our paths. Sharing your knowledge is a **critical** leadership skill and will enable even more Fellows to advance confidently along their paths to their dreams.  
3. Use the Skill Tracker to see where your skills place you on your journey along these growth paths, identify outputs that will help you fill in missing gaps. 
4. Join the Slack Channel(s) listed on each path and participate in weekly meetups, group projects, and resource sharing!

## Please... give us some `ASK Feedback`!
`Growth Paths` are inspired by the powerful dreams of Andela Fellows... that's `you.` We want to make sure that the structure of these paths gives you the **confidence,** **counsel,** and **community** to channel your inspiration into transformation (of yourself, the company, and the **world**). 

We cannot do it without your Feedback-- [please use this Form](https://docs.google.com/a/andela.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXaQ18J2oqQdVEOD5LkXyTbansZidQolcXwL6cMqNZOhu8lQ/viewform?usp=sf_link), Slack ([#ask-learing](https://andela.slack.com/messages/ask-learning); [#learning-map](https://andela.slack.com/messages/learning-map); @nora.studholme; @nad; @oli), or any other form of communication _(smoke signals, hand-delivered notes, and carrier pigeons accepted)_ to let us know what's working, what's confusing, and what you need. 

Together, we are #limitless. TIA!
