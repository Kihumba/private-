# Project Management Interview Preparation

A Project Manager is responsible for the planning & execution of a particular project within their company. Projects can be technical or nontechnical, can have teams of 2 or 200, and can last a few days, a few weeks, or even years. 

It is important for PM's working on technical clients to have a level of domain knowledge in a sector (aka experience programming in several languages). Project Management is not limited to a particular field, and you should be familiar and comfortable overseeing many different components of a project. 

Leadership is also key-- not only will a good PM have leadership experience, they should *want* to continue having Leadership Experience, and desire a role in which they help support others rather than focusing on their own code. 

As a Project Manager you will be responsible for the quality of your projects, so you should have an interest in and at least cursory understanding of [the QA Role](https://github.com/andela/learningmap/tree/master/D1/D1%20Test%20Engineer). You should be able to do quality tests yourself, although some teams will have Test or QA Engineers to help you.

Finally, you should be familiar with the [Agile Scrum](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nc3hAUJbfNVYIwwPdAh7cCgbNQxbpyzGWMaX9CqzyC0/edit#heading=h.aw40qdtqf391) process. Make sure you have shadowed, asked plenty of questions, [done outside research & learning](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/the-scrum-framework), and practiced these methodologies. 

## Types of Questions

Project Management Interviews are in two main components: 

1) [Past Work:](https://github.com/andela/learningmap/tree/master/D4+/Project%20Manager/Communicating%20your%20Past%20Work) *What work have you done in the past that falls into a Leadership role, or that has overlapping skills with Project Management?* 
2) [Case Studies:](https://github.com/andela/learningmap/tree/master/D4+/Project%20Manager/Case%20Study%20Questions) *If you were a Project Manager on X project and Y happened, what would you do?*

See the resources for each  of these linked to this document.

## How to Prepare for your PM Role

* Read about Agile Scrum-- Know it inside and out
* **Volunteer to Lead a particular project**
  * There is no replacement for hands-on experience, and this will give you stories to draw on for your past work and case study questions. 
  * Don't worry if the project you're leading is not technical-- as long as you are leading a team, working on a project with a timeline, and growing a program/project/technology, you are getting invaluable Project Management experience. 
  * Through your hands on experience you should learn how to handle deadlines, quality, cost, budget, and team.
* **Learn from your Team**
  * If you absolutely don’t have the opportunity to perform in a leadership role (this is unlikely, especially since a project can even just be a few weeks long!), then this is a good alternative. And it is *always* a good additional step toward becoming an effective PM. 
  * Shadow your Team Leads at Andela and on your Client
  * Ask as many questions as possible to understand the motives behind every decision that is made; try to get the big picture
    * FOR EXAMPLE: We require a D4 learning map for Project Management, why are we building it? Why haven’t we done it yet? How does this role fit into the broader picture of Andela? How are we planning to get it done? What will it cost (time, $)? How will we manage quality? 
  * Put yourself in the shoes of the project leaders and the big picture projects they are working on

**Note:** *Many learners ask if they should get [PMP certified](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/pmp-introduction-project-management-pmp-exam) before applying for this role. In a word: No. PMP is a way for Project Managers to track the hours that they have gotten, and is for those who have worked as PM's for several years already. That being said, the learning resources to support the PMP Certification are great, so feel free to use them to learn and grow into the role!*
