## Past Work
You don't need to have worked as a Project Manager to have gained Project Management Skills from your past work. Some areas to draw on are: 

- If you've ever had a leadership role (Team Lead, Society Head, etc)
- If you've ever led an initiative or a project on your client or at Andela (workshop, new feature, etc)
- Any time you were *responsible for a group of people*
- Any time you were *responsible for making something grow* 

Take a few minutes and reflect on your past work. Make a list of **all** the situations, roles, and projects you worked on that could qualify for these criteria.
