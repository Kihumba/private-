*[See the full Product Manager Learning Objectives and Work Outputs here!](https://docs.google.com/a/andela.com/document/d/1c6AkQqE_ktvqLVzdPRchKXWfN1BwMR1xqga3krLsKiU/edit?usp=sharing)*

Product Manager Growth Path at Andela is designed to give experienced Developers real-world opportunities to work on building their Product Management skills. The path provides resources and work outputs that will enable Fellows to leverage Product Management skills every day at Andela and on Client Work. Those who are interested in going deeper can explore internal apprenticeships or the [Apprentice Product Lead](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hqp-BT0YDg1AB0-N9QRK9Fq7RZ63m1-ro-JgDqq4edo/edit#heading=h.eyxqoji7x8fn) program. You can also see ["More Practice"](https://github.com/andela/learningmap/tree/master/D4%2B/Product%20Manager/Curriculum/More%20Practice) in the Growth Path Curriculum for other suggestions on how to get real world experience in Product Management. 

This curriculum is meant as a guide to start exploring what work you will do as a Product Manager. This path is not currently a Client Placement Track: instead, it is designed to allow Fellows to build experience and skills that will move them toward becoming a Product Manager in the future *through Client and Andela work*.
