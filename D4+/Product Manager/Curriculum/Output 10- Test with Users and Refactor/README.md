# Output 10- Test with Users and Refactor

- **The Product:** Although you’ve been working with many stakeholders and developers, a product is ultimately built for users. So you’ll need to learn what works and what doesn’t through their hands.  <br>
- **The Process:** Release an MVP of your product through Heroku and set up a user session where you can observe users as they interact with your product. Take careful notes on what they do and say, and try not to influence them by explaining anything.  <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** Create a user analysis that outlines what you’ve learned and the next steps from your experience. Bring this to your team in the next Sprint Planning session, and use it to refactor our PRD.

| How to release an MVP for testing |  
| When to run a new release | 
| How to test a product with users	|
| </br> | 
| **Behaviors** 	| 
|  **Context:** When I am setting up a user test, **Action:** I let users know that everything they say is valid and valuable, and that they should share their immediate reactions. 	|  
| **Context:** When I am running a user test, **Action:** I try not to answer questions they ask and instead observe and encourage them to share their thoughts without jumping in.  |
| **Context:** After I run a user test, **Action:** I synthesize and condense the information into key takeaways to see what patterns emerged for areas of improvement.  |  
| </br> | 
| **Beliefs**	| 
| A product is ultimately built for a user-- even a technically “fancy” product has failed if a user cannot use it easily and effectively.  |
