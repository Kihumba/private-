# Output 2- Conduct Market Research

- **The Product:** In order to make sure you’re prioritizing the appropriate features, or the appropriate product entirely for that matter, it is critical that you get to know your market.  <br>
- **The Process:** First, write a market research plan that clearly outlines the qualitative & quantitative questions you need to answer to address your assumptions. You can conduct market research in a number of ways-- consider which of the following is the most appropriate for the answers you need to gather from your future users: 
	- Surveys
	- Observation (in person) 
	- Interviews (group or individual)
	- Reading white papers, government reports, etc.
	- Seminars, conventions, panels <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** You’ll need to analyze your findings to translate them into product recommendations. Writing User Personas is a great next step for this (Output 3). Remember that you don’t just need to do market research once-- you should continually be testing and gathering feedback from users as your product continues to evolve.

| **Behaviors** 	| 
|  **Context:** Before I act on any assumptions I might have about a product, **Action:** I conduct Market Research to inform my decisions. |  
| **Context:** When I am developing a research plan, **Action:** I divide it into qualitative and quantitative research questions.  |
| **Context:** When I have gathered all my market research, **Action:** I analyze my findings and determine their implications for my product requirements.  |  
| **Context:** When I have a new set of product requirements documented, **Action:** I make sure to note how they are backed up with the data I have gathered to give legitimacy to my decisions when working with stakeholders. |
| </br> | 
| **Beliefs**	| 
| Even when market research contradicts my assumptions and makes me scrap work I’ve been doing, listening to my research will benefit me, my product, and my team. |  
| Market research does not just happen once at the beginning of a product launch-- I should be continually testing and challenging my own assumptions. |
