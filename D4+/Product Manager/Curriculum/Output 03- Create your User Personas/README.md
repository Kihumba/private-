# Output 3- Create your User Personas

- **The Product:** Any product will be designed for a set of end users, and a Product Manager’s job is to know those users so intimately that they can constantly ensure that their team’s product development is in the best interest of the end user. User Persona’s are a critical way for PMs to define their end users, their archetypes, their goals in using the product, their fears, their needs. Personas allow a PM to maintain their focus on [User-centred Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design). <br>
- **The Process:** You should always establish at least 3 user personas-- one “average” user, and one outlier on either end of the spectrum of your users. Make sure you model your personas on real users-- ask yourself “Who is this product trying to reach?” and create a set of user personas based on your answer. User Personas should include (at minimum): 
	- Attributes: Name, Age, etc.
	- ”Tag Line” (3-5 word description of user)
	- What they do in life (student, tech worker, etc)
	- What experience they have 
	- Goals when performing tasks with your product (speed, accuracy, looking good while using it)
	- How often do they interact with the product
	- In what context do they interact with the product
	- Do they access on Mobile or PC? 
	- Work alone or in a team?
	- Quotes (from interviews)
	- Concerns (about your product, how can you earn trust)  <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** Creating personas is best done as a team, and should be based on your market research. Brainstorm the attributes that users shared, and what you learned about their needs through the research phase. You can write up attributes on sticky notes, then group them together into roles-- another benefit of doing this as a team is that you can get more personal buy-in from every member of your development team, and they will be developing with the end users in mind.

| **Context:** When I am creating user personas, **Action:** I start by investigating who I want to reach with my product (market of users). |
| **Context:** Once I know the market I want to reach, **Action:** I define their characteristics and their goals in using my product. |  
| **Context:** When I am creating personas for my product, **Action:** I always create three or more (one average, two extremes/edge cases).  |  
| </br> | 
| **Beliefs**	| 
| My product is only as valuable as the use my end user gets from it.  |  
| By designing with my end user in mind, I can create an impactful, transformative product. |
