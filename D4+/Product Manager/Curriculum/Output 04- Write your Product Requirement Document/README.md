# Output 04- Write your Product Requirement Document (PRD) 

- **The Product:** If you’re joining a new team, they may already have a PRD defined. That doesn’t mean it is perfect, though-- most PM’s review and refactor their PRD’s on a bi-weekly basis anyway, so this is your chance to make sure everything is in alignment before launching into your product. <br>
- **The Process:** Simply stated, your PRD will define the problems your product will solve with general descriptions of features. Make sure to include: 
>> * The “why” behind the product you’re building (including key stakeholders and users) 
>> * The goals of your product and how they will be measured
- **The Follow-Through:** Share this document with your stakeholders and development team for feedback, and refactor based on their recommendations.

| **Behaviors** 	| 
|  **Context:** When I am writing a PRD, **Action:** I begin with a product definition.  	|  
| **Context:** When I am writing a product definition, **Action:** I start by identifying the benefits, assumptions, and constraints of my product’s stakeholders and users.|
| **Context:** When I am writing up product specs, **Action:** I keep them as brief as possible and focus on the user story rather than the technical details. |  
| </br> | 
| **Beliefs**	| 
| Outlining the goals of my product helps me empathize with my users.  |  
| Getting too technically deep into my product at the start can prevent me from seeing how people will reallly interact with it. |  
| A remarkable customer experience starts with heart, intuition, and curiosity. |
