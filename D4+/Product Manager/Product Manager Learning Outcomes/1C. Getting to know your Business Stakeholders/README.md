| **Behaviors** |
| **Context:** When I am starting a product interview with my Stakeholders, **Action:** I start with the question, “what are we solving for?”. | 
| **Context:** Once I know what we are solving for, **Action:** I determine who it will impact by asking “Who is interacting with this?” | 
| **Context:** After I determine what we are solving for and for whom, **Action:** I find the level of need by asking “What happens if we don’t solve this problem?” | 
| **Context:** Before I dive into any technology for a new product, **Action:** I ask tons of questions of my product stakeholders to understand the goal so that I know if my team is hitting it’s mark. |
