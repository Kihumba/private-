# Developing End User Empathy

### Definition
As a Product Manager, you are coordinating with a team of developers and diverse Business Stakeholders, but ultimately what matters is how your End User experiences your product. To get in touch with your end user it is important to:  
  - Ability to describe (and use) good UX / UI Design
  - Ability to conduct A/B testing and use results to validate a product idea
  - Ability to conduct non-biased user research and synthesize the feedback into actionable features for a product
  - Ability to manage Usability Testing, Beta Testing, & Test Marketing
