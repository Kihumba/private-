# Running a Product Requirements Analysis / Design Sprint

### Definition
You will likely run a Product Requirement Analysis and/or Design sprint several times throughout the course of your Product's lifecycle. The abilities you will exercise are: 
  - Ability to conduct planning sessinos to ensure the product is aligned with the goals and that the goals are realigned with the market need
  - Ability to leverage business and technical stakeholders 

No matter whether you are running a design sprint for a brand new product, or reassessing your requirements document for an existing one, key questions you will be answering in your Product Analysis are as follows: 
1. What are we solving for? 
2. Who is interacting with this? 
3. Why are we solving this problem? What happens if we don’t solve it? 
4. How will we know if we’ve succeeded? 
5. What are our next steps?

| **Behaviors** |
| **Context:** When I am starting a design sprint, **Action:** I start with the question, “what are we solving for?” |
| **Context:** Once I know what we are solving for, **Action:** I determine who it will impact by asking “Who is interacting with this?” |
| **Context:** After I determine what we are solving for and for whom, **Action:** I find the level of need by asking “What happens if we don’t solve this problem?” | 
| **Context:** Once I know the level of need, **Action:** I define success for the problem’s resolution without using a product solution: “How will we know if we’ve succeeded?” | 
| **Context:** Before I dive into any technology for a new product, **Action:** I ask tons of questions to understand the goal so that I know if my team is hitting it’s mark. | 
| **Context:** If I get stuck in my product understanding, **Action:** I ask “What would a perfect product do?” | 
| **Context:** Once I have a clear vision of my product, my users, and my product’s definition of success, **Action:** I write user stories for every user of my product. | 
| **Context:** After writing user stories, **Action:** I map out the “user path” of how someone interacts with my product. | 
| **Context:** If i get stuck in my line of questioning about a product, **Action:** I go back to the list of values that it is meant to add and ask how it does each of those things. |

| ***Beliefs*** | 
| Belief: It is better to ask a ridiculous number of questions than to let one tiny detail escape. | 
| Belief: Questions are currency-- the more I ask, the more respect and capability I have. |
