# Output 07- Run a Standup

- **The Product:** As a Product Manager, you will be responsible for running daily Standups (recommended to run in the mornings for no more than 30 minutes)<br>
- **The Process:** You can run these in person (over Hangouts) or via Slack. Either way, make sure that reminders are set on your team’s calendar and/or in your product Slack Channel.  <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** Because this will occur every day, set yourself a calendar reminder to reflect on the Feedback you receive (and input into LV to track your progress). This will be hugely impactful in your growth as a PM.

| **Context:** When my team contributes during a daily standup, **Action:** I make sure they are sharing from a user/stakeholder perspective rather than from an engineering-focused mentality. |
| **Context:** When I am running a Standup in Slack, **Action:** I respond to every Slack message to let my team know that I’ve read and reviewed their Standup report (even with a simple emoji reaction). |  
| **Context:** When I read/hear that a team member has blockers, **Action:** I follow up with them in person or on DM in slack to help unblock them. |
| </br> | 
| **Beliefs**	| 
| A daily standup is a critical tool to make sure that the product team is working in synch and that all blockers are discovered as quickly as possible.  |
