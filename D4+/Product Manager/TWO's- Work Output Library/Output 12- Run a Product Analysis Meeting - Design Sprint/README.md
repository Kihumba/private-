# Output 12- Run a Design Sprint/ Product Analysis

- **The Product:** Run a design/product sprint to define an existing or new product. 
- **The Process:** Include at least 3 other people in your sprint-- ideally with some knowledge of your product, but an “outsider” can be helpful as well for diversity of opinion. Ask and document the following questions: 
> - What are we solving for? 
> - Who is interacting with this? 
> - Why are we solving this problem? What happens if we don’t solve it? 
> - How will we know if we’ve succeeded? 
> - What are our next steps? 
- **The Follow-Through:** _Always_ dig in for more details! You can never have enough. Fail to assume even the tiniest things.

| How to run a design sprint | 
| How to write user stories |

| **Behaviors**	| 
| **Context:** When I am starting a design sprint, **Action:** I start with the question, “What are we solving for?”
| **Context:** Once I know what we are solving for, **Action:** I determine who it will impact by asking “Who is interacting with this?”
| **Context:** After I determine what we are solving for and for whom, **Action:** I find the level of need by asking “What happens if we don’t solve this problem?”
| **Context:** Once I know the level of need, **Action:** I define success for the problem’s resolution without using a product solution: “How will we know if we’ve succeeded?”
| **Context:** Before I dive into any technology for a new product, **Action:** I ask *tons* of questions to understand the goal so that I know if my team is hitting it’s mark. 
| **Context:** If I get stuck in my product understanding, **Action:** I ask “What would a perfect product do?”
| **Context:** Once I have a clear vision of my product, my users, and my product’s definition of success, **Action:** I write user stories for every user of my product. 
| **Context:** After writing user stories, **Action:** I map out the “user path” of how someone interacts with my product. | 
| **Context:** If i get stuck in my line of questioning about a product, **Action:** I go back to the list of values that it is meant to add and ask how it does each of those things. |

| **Beliefs**	| 
| It is better to ask a ridiculous number of questions than to let one tiny detail escape. | 
| Questions are currency-- the more I ask, the more respect and capability I have. |
