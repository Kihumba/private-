# Output 1- Get Set Up with your Team

- **The Product:** You might be building a new product, or you may be coming in midway through an existing one. Either way, before you start building or planning anything, you’ll need to get set up with your team. <br>
- **The Process:** Take some time to review what your team has built so far (if anything), who your main stakeholders and users are. Also get set up on any existing collaboration tools, or set up new ones if none exist yet (Slack, GitHub, Trello, Heroku)  <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** Spend some time with your new team! Get to know them as people as well-- #RelationshipsMatter.
