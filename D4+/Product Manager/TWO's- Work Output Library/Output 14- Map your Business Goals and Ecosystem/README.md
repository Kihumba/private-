# Output 14- Map your business goals & Ecosystem

- **The Product:** In order to be an effective product manager, you need to understand more than just your product, its goals, and its metrics of success. You must also understand what drives success for your business, and what goes into that success.
- **The Process:** Map out your entire “business ecosystem.” Start with the overall goal & business process of your company-- what does it aim to do? Who does it serve? How do you know if it’s succeeding? How does it make money? What costs are involved? Include every product that your business has, how each one measures success, and how each impacts the higher level business goals. 
- **The Follow-Through:** Bring this to a leader at your company to get feedback. Don’t be afraid to do this-- if you’re wrong in certain places or missed something big, or made an assumption that is incorrect, they will be deeply impressed with the fact that you took the time to think through it, and will be happy about your mistake or misunderstanding because you gave them the opportunity to bring you (and thus your team) into alignment. Remember, every individual and product at your company is like a vector, with a direction and a force. If you are all pointed in the same direction toward your business goal, you will be a successful business. But if your product is pointed in a different direction, no matter how well you execute against your own goals you will actually be damaging the business.
