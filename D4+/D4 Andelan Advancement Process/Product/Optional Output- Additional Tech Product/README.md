# Optional Output- Additional Technical Product
This is a purely optional output, included here to remind you to think carefully about all of your experiences at Andela, or even before, to help you tell your full D4 Growth Story.

An additional technical work output could include: 
- Pre-Andela Work
- Side Project(s) you had while at Andela
- "Level-up Apprenticeship" product at Andela
- Mentor pairing during which you built a product
- Products built for a Growth Path group (eg. data science research, design product, etc.) 
- ... or anything else! 

> **Note:** Until LV is ready, you can prepare these in a Google Docs or Google Slides format, whatever is easiest for you.

## What to Include
The requirements for any optional products are the same as the three required products: 
- Link to Product
- Role
- Stack/Language(s)
- Team Size/Structure
- Stakeholders
- Most Important skill you learned from this work (tech or team)
- Biggest Challenge during this work

*As you are describing your Products, the experiences you had, and what you learned, make sure to explicitly tie in how the skills you learned will tie into your chosen D4 Role-- this is your D4 Growth Story.*
