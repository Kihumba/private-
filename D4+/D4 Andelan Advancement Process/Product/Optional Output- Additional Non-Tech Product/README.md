# Optional Output- Additional Technical Product
This is a purely optional output, included here to help you include any *nontechnical* work that you've done in your D4 Growth Story. Non-technical work is still deeply transformational-- skills like teamwork, mentorship, leadership, communication, stakeholder management, estimation... and many many more... can be gained through nontechnical projects. 

An additional technical work output could include: 
- Mentorship work outside Andela Hours (Girls who Code, etc.)
- Speaking at an event (at Andela or otherwise)
- Putting together a program (inside or outside Andela)
- Leadership/participation in a society
- Contributing significantly to Andela processes & programs (for example, *contributing to the build of D4 Advancement criteria...*) 
- ... or anything else! 

***Note:** Until LV is ready, you can prepare these in a Google Docs or Google Slides format, whatever is easiest for you. *

# What to Include
Make sure to call out the skills you've learned during the project(s) you include. Reflect deeply on this-- you will probably come up with many more than immediately meet the eye once you start thinking about all that you were able to learn from your experience! Again, be sure to explicitly connect those skills to the D4 role you are applying for, showing how this past experience will inform your future work. 

Please upload your project(s) to LV with the following: 
- Link to any materials about your project (or anything that was created as a result)
- Description of Project
- Description of your Role
- Teammates on project
- Stakeholders on project
- Feedback from at least one teammate
- Most important lessons you learned from the project
- Biggest challenge of the product
