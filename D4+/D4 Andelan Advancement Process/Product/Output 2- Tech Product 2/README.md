# Output 2- Tech Product 2
Over the past 3 years at Andela, you’ve worked for many different clients, from D0 Apprenticeship, to Internal Andela Products, to external Client placements. 

This is your space to tell your story, show off the work you’ve done, and connect it to how the skills you’ve learned so far have prepared you for your D4 Role.

Tell us about the applications you’ve worked on and your role in them. Tell us about your team and how you worked with them.  Most importantly, tell us where you struggled, what you learned, how you grew, and how you’ll apply what you learned. 

> **Note:** Until LV is ready, you can prepare these in a Google Docs or Google Slides format, whatever is easiest for you.
