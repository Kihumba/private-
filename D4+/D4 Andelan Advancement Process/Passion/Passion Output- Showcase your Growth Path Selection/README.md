# Output- Showcase your Growth Path Passion
When applying for a new role, it cannot be expected that you've done that role already... after all, then it wouldn't be "new!" So how do we show that we've prepared for this role as much as we possibly can, demonstrate the level of passion we have for the work, and highlight what we're most excited to continue learning about as we progress in the role? 

This Output is simply a recap summary of the learning you've done so far about your selected Growth Path. It is meant to help you show off all the hard work you’ve done on your own, and the dedication you have to your chosen path!

You have a passion for this role… why is it your passion? What have you done to explore so far? What have you learned? How have you learned? Who have you worked with, shadowed, or spoken with, and what expert perspectives did they share with you? 

> **Note:** Until LV is ready, you can prepare these in a Google Docs or Google Slides format, whatever is easiest for you.
