# Optional Output- Showcase your Growth Path Work == Learning
This is a purely optional Output, included here to give you the opportunity to take your passion one step further. If you've worked on a project or product for your selected Growth Path, this is the opportunity to showcase it. Examples of this might be: 

- Internal Level up Apprenticeship
- Side Project (technical product) 
- Organizing a program (eg. launching the machine learning path at Andela, organizing a speaker for your Growth Path topic, etc.)

> **Note:** Until LV is ready, you can prepare these in a Google Docs or Google Slides format, whatever is easiest for you.

## What to Include: 
The requirements for any optional products are similar to the Required Passion Output: 
- Link to your product / project / program
- Teammates you worked with 
- Stakeholders you worked with
- Feedback from at least one Teammate/Stakeholder
- Mentors you worked with
- Reflections on what you learned
- Reflections on new questions this experience surfaced for you 

--- 

**Note:**

If you are applying for a focus other than: 
- Software Architect
- Product Management
- Project Management

... You should be prepared to complete this.
