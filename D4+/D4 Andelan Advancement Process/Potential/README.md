In this context, we define potential as: *“Passing a minimum bar of competence and demonstration of the ability to learn and apply skills quickly.”*

You will demonstrate this in your D4 Assessment through Story Telling (your past work, what you’ve learned, the skills that translate to your path) and through Situational/ Case Study Questions asked by your Assessment Panel in person. These Case Studies will draw on your past experience, expected baseline knowledge of skills required for your path, and real-world situational examples you will encounter in this role. 

## What to Include
During your D4 Assessment (in person), you will be asked to dig into several real-world, situational case studies that reflect work you would be asked to do in your chosen growth path role. You can prepare using the resources in this curriculum-- if at all possible, it is recommended that you go through these (and other) case studies with a mentor or Experienced Practitioner in the role you are applying for. Don't hesitate to reach out!
