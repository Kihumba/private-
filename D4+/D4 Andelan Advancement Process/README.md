# D4 Andelan- Advancement Criteria, Process, & Preparation

## What Is D4? 
Advancement to D4 is a significant step in every Fellowâ€™s unique journey to becoming a Global Technology Leader. **Year 4 is a Career Launcher for Fellows** in addition to being a value add to Andela, and Fellows who advance to D4 are committing to a life-long community while being offered in return full hands-on support in the next steps of their career. 

For **D4 Placements**, we are committed to looking for companies that would be good partners for **APM (Product or Project Manager)** and/or **Software Architect** roles, among other Growth Path options. That being said, this is a new process and will take time, experimentation, and continued collaboration. Therefore, there is currenty no *"guarantee"* that Fellows will immediately transition into their Focus/ Growth Path of choice. 

That being said, we (Fellows, Learning, Success) also commit providing opportunities to build the skills necessary to *have a conversation within a current client role* (whatever that may be) that helps Fellows identify gaps and showcase themselves as the person to fix them. We also commit to continuing to provide opportunities for all learners to build their portfolios of work outputs & networks of Mentors for their chosen path!

## What are the D4 Advancement Criteria? 
Because Year 4 is a significant step into the world of Global Technology Leadership, the Advancement process for D4 is designed to reflect how "real world" job applications work as closely as possible. 

When we apply for a job, we are not expected to have done that *exact job* previously. Rather, we are tasked to **advocate for ourselves** by telling our story, relating what we've done in the past to the skills that we will need in the job we are applying for in the future, and conveying our deep passion and dedication continuing to learn in the role. 

For these criteria, these distill into **the 3 P's of Advancement:** 
- **Product:** 
> A structured "story" of the work you've produced in the past, and how the skills you built through those experiences will translate to your future work. 
- **Passion:**
> A track record of consistent proactive effort to connect with people and experiences that drive learning in this domain.
- **Potential:**
> Passing a minimum bar of competence and demonstration of the ability to learn and apply skills quickly through creation of related work products to this domain.


***Note:**
This is a Soft Launch and we would love your **ASK Feedback.** [Please DM Nora](https://andela.slack.com/messages/@nora.studholme/) with any suggestions, thoughts, or questions!*
