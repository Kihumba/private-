## Qualities of Great Entrepreneurs

There is no single definition of a "good entrepreneur." Take some time to explore the Words of Wisdom and Inspiration pages on the Entrepreneurship Curriculum Site, and you'll see how many diverse the backgrounds of successful entrepreneurs are-- some are technical, some are philosophical, some never finish school, some have PhD's. 

Even so, we wanted to see if there were any consistent qualities that came up in Entrepreneurs. We interviewed the experts (entrepreneurs, VC investors, incubator managers, startup advisors) to understand a few of the key qualities that entrepreneurs either naturally have or consciously work on building. 

This is not to say you must go down the row and check off every attribute. It doesn't mean if you are missing #7 your company is doomed. But it is a call for self-exploration and reflection. 

 After dozens of conversations, are the **top 9 Entrepreneurial Qualities** that we walked away with: 


1. **Mindfulness-** You are self-aware, and aware of the world around you at all times. No ego-- be able to try and fail and be honest with yourself to learn the lessons those failures offer. 

2. **Persistence-** If things aren’t going well, you figure out what the root cause of the problem is and make sure you address that. A huge part of success is not giving up (but still being reasonable and smart about it!) 

3. **Optimism-** You believe the future will be better and that your company will play an important role in making it better.

4. **Focus-**  You are obsessed. You can hone in and focus like no other, and achieve 90% of the results with 10% of the effort. 

5. **Domain Expertise-** You are obsessed with becoming brilliant and saturated in your domain-- you are ALWAYS learning.

6. **Speed & Efficiency-** You are in a race— How long will your customers wait around for yuor improved features? How long will your team work at half pay while you get the company off the ground?

7. **Presentation Skills-** Communication, mindfulness of verbal & physical presentation are key for Entrepreneurs.

8. **Empathy-** There are plenty of hard working, smart, people… but they don’t understand what motivates other people. It’s hard to do early sales or get a team if you don’t know what matters to people.

9. **Lifelong Learner-** You are addicted to learning, to continually improving, to failing and getting better because of it.
