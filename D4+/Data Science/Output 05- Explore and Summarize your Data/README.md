# Output 05- Explore and Summarize your Data

- **The Product:** Now itâ€™s time to build a model to analyze your data-- the fun part! Try fitting and validating the model you have, and then narrow in on how you could make your statistical model fit your data more appropriately. Create and run a new model to analyze the precise question and hypothesis you want to explore.
- **The Process:** You can use R, Python, or any other tools you like. Apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies. 
- **The Follow-Through:** Summarize your findings in a document-- You'll be making a presentation and visualizations of them soon as well.
