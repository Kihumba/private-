# Output 07- Write a Model

- **The Product:** Now that you have a clean dataset, apply various algorithms to extract meaning from your data. 
- **The Process:** Try various statistical analyses, recursive analysis, regression testing, and compare. 
- **The Follow-Through:** Be careful here-- you can always fit your data to some algorithm or model, so make sure you are choosing the best model for your data, and not just the one that will give you the answer you wanted.

| **Knowledge**	| 
| How classification modeling differs from numeric data  |  
| How to write a predictive algorithm | 
| How to choose the best model (or combination of models) to give me the most accurate results	|
| Difference between binary classification models and non-binary classification models |
| </br> | 
| **Behaviors** 	| 
|  **Context:** When I have a good sample of data, **Action:** I extract it and feed it to my models. |  
| **Context:** When I have several possible models, **Action:** I score and compare them and interpret the results.  |
| **Context:** When there are inconsistencies in my data that prevent my models from processing it, **Action:** I interpolate appropriately. |  
| </br> | 
| **Beliefs**	| 
| Data science allows me to make decisions in an informed way. |  
| Data science letâ€™s me see into the future.|
