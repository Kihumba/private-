# Output 04- Investigate your Data Set

- **The Product:** Generate a hypothesis based on your questions and initial exploration-- you will use this hypothesis in the next output when you build a model for your data. 
- **The Process:** Start with "exploratory graphs" to explore your data. Graphics are information dense and can communicate a great deal about your dataset in a concise way, allowing you to see details *and* the big picture of your data. Use them to start checking the shape of your data's distribution, and any gaps or outliers that exist.
- **The Follow-Through:** After you've explored using basic graphics, use Exploratory Statistics to dig deeper into your data. You're not modeling yet, simply exploring, checking the effects of manipulating your data, seeing how your data reacts to variation, etc.

| **"KBB's"** <br> _What do experts think, do, and feel as they work through this task?_|
|----------|
| </br>| 
| **Knowledge**	| 
| Types of graphs and how to use each to explore data |  
| How to deal with different types of missing data |  
| Categories of methods used in Exploratory Statistics |  
| </br> | 
| **Behaviors** 	| 
| **Context:** When I am first exploring my dataset, **Action:** I use exploratory graphs to check the shape, gaps, and outliers in my distribution. |
| **Context:** When I am starting to explore my dataset, **Action:** I start with single-variable distributions, one variable at a time. |  
| **Context:** After I have explored single-variable distributions of my data, **Action:** I explore joint distributions to understand how variables impact each other. |  
unusual cases, errors in the data, missing data. 

| </br> | 
| **Beliefs**	| 
| I don't need fancy tools to explore my data-- I can even do it by hand. |
