# Output 10- Showcase your Work

Ask another question… and answer it! Try to win a Kaggle competition. Join the Slack channel #data-sci-curriculum and join weekly meetups to talk through your challenges, learnings, and projects. Gather a team to work with you on a larger data project. Complete a project for Andela and pitch to real end users. Build a Slack app that scrapes data. Make something that will make your own life easier or answer questions that you have. The opportunities are endless-- just don’t forget to share your work to advocate for yourself. Create a [Profile on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/?login=true), link it to your LinkedIn profile, upload to the [Fellow Project Showcase](https://github.com/andela/learningmap/tree/master/D4%2B/Fellow%20Project%20Showcase) on this Repo, and share your work!
