# Optional Questions & Project Ideas To Work From
You do not need to use these questions if you already have your own that you want to answer! Andela is full of rich data questions, and so is life everywhere you look. Choose at least two to complete and present. 
 
1. A/B Testing - Design and analyze an A/B test for a product (tech or nonotech) that is trying out a new iteration or design. Use control variables for a matched pair design A/B test. Write up a recommendation on which of the options the product team should go with. 
_If you do one of these-- try this one! A/B testing is an important skill for a data scientist to have!_
- Knowledge: 
> - A/B testing Fundamentals
> - Randomized Design Tests
> - Matched Pair Design Tests



2. If you need a softer launch, do Kaggle’s project [“Titanic, Machine Learning from Disaster”](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) as a practice.


3. How fast is the market for data scientists growing? Think about splitting up your analysis by region or other distinctions. 


4. Create a Slack Bot that uses data you have gathered from an external site (shopping, airplane fares, craigslist, etc.).
- Example [here](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/apartment-finding-slackbot/)


5. What informs what paths Fellows choose to pursue at Andela? Is it Learning Speed? Past experience? Other attributes? 
- Look at Fellows in the first 3 months of Andela and predict what they’ll be doing in D3. Consider the impact this would have on our ability to pipeline. 


6. What tech skills will be most in demand in 2019? 
- To get started, consider looking at the past 3-5 years of stack overflow information and survey data.
- Identify the best sources in the tech space and pick out patterns from Tweets, Blog Posts, etc.


7. Recruitment patterns: Gather data on how we describe people during the Andela interview process and determine predictors of who becomes an Andelan based on attributes they show. 


8. Choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about. Choose to learn SQL or MongoDB and apply your chosen schema to the project.


9. Kaggle Competitions
- Compete seriously! Seriously competing in a kaggle featured competition, trying to get the highest rank possible. Very intense, fun, and a great learning experience.
