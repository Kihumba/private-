# Output 05- Explore and Summarize your Data

- **The Product:** Now itâ€™s time to build a model to analyze your data-- the fun part! Try fitting and validating the model you have, and then narrow in on how you could make your statistical model fit your data more appropriately. Create and run a new model to analyze the precise question and hypothesis you want to explore.
- **The Process:** You can use R, Python, or any other tools you like. Apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies. 
- **The Follow-Through:** Summarize your findings in a document-- You'll be making a presentation and visualizations of them soon as well.

| **"KBB's"** <br> _What do experts think, do, and feel as they work through this task?_|
|----------|
| </br>| 
| **Knowledge**	| 
| How to use data reduction to help mine your data |  
| How to use Classification for prediction |  
| How and when to use clustering for analyzing your data |  
| How and when to use anomoly detection |  
| </br> | 
| **Behaviors** 	| 
|  **Context:** Before I analyze my data, **Action:** I reduce it to focus in on the variables that are most likely to carry the meaning I am looking to extract, and the least likely to carry noise that will distract.	|  
| **Context:** After data reduction, **Action:** I do cluster analysis to put "Like with Like." |
| **Context:** After I do a cluster analysis, **Action:** I run an association analysis. |
| **Context:** When I want to see the future through data, **Action:** I use classification, anomoly detection, and association analysis. |
| **Context:** When I want to predict the impact of some variables on another, **Action:** I use regression analysis. |
| </br> | 
| **Beliefs**	| 
| More data is not always better-- good data science is meticulous about Quality over Quantity. |  
| Anomoly detection allows me to find the unexpected so that I can react to it appropriately. |
