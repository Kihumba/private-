# Data Science Growth Path
A Data Scientist is XXXXX


The Data Science Growth Path at Andela is designed to support Fellows in seeking out real-world opportunities to build their Data Science skills and portfolio. This path is not a Client Placement Track: instead, it is designed to allow Fellows to build experience and skills that will move them toward becoming a leader in the Data Science field in the future, while providing meaningful work and analysis for Andela.
