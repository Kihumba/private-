# Outcome 5 - Exceptions in Java

## Skill Description
----------
A person with this skill can effectively make use of exception handling in Java application development. They aware of the different categories of Java exceptions and have good understanding of the Java exception hierarchy. They can write user-defined exceptions that propagate meaningful information about application failure.



## Outputs
----------
- **Task:** Write a Java program that throws an unchecked exception and handles the exception neatly to avoid application termination at runtime.
- **Resources:** Command line & Notepad and/or your favourite IDE.
- **Include:** N/A

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Context: When I need to print stack trace from an exception Action: I use a logger as oppose calling “printStacktrace()”. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Context: When I need to use resources (like streams) Action: I use `try-with-resources` for auto resource management. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Context: When I need to catch multiple exceptions, Action: I use a single `catch` block. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Context: When I want to prevent resource leaks, Action: I use the `Finally Block` to run any cleanup-type statements irrespective of the occurrence of an exception. | [ ] | [ ]  |
