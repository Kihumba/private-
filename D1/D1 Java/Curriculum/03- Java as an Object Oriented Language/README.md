# Outcome 3 - Java as an Object Oriented Language

## Skill Description
----------
A person with this skill can explain what it means to say that in Java, everything is an object. They can explain how object oriented programming attempts to model solutions to problems just as we perceive the real world: with objects. 


## Outputs
----------
- **Task:** Describe a class of objects from the real world, state their attributes, and their behavior. Then list and explain the basic Java OOP fundamental concepts. 
- **Resources:** Use any medium for your description (drawing, infographic, blog post, etc.)
- **Include:** N/A

## Alternative output: 
- **Task:** Create a basic object oriented program that solves a real world problem.
- **Resources:** Use Java and run in command line or your favorite IDE.
- **Include:** N/A
