# Outcome 3- JavaScript Data Structures

## Skill Description
A person with this skill is familiar with JavaScript’s main data structures, and can use them efficiently according to the needs of their application. They know the advantages and disadvantages of each data structure, and are able to thoughtfully navigate these when choosing and working with the structure in their code. 

## Output: 
- **Task:** Create a simple JavaScript application that makes use of strings, variables, and literals. 
- **Resources:** Use the most effective data structure for your task, and be able to defend why this was the best choice.
- **Include:** Share this with another developer and discuss the benefits and drawbacks you each experienced using the structures you chose.

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am writing a statement in my JavaScript code, **Action:** I never start with an object literal. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to append a variable to a literal, **Action:** I use the ‘+=’ Operator. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to store multiple values in one variable, **Action:** I use an array. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to access or modify array data, **Action:** I use indexes. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to find a certain word or pattern inside a string, **Action:** I use ‘regular expressions’. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to store data that will be constantly updated, **Action:** I prefer using an object with id keys over using an array. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
