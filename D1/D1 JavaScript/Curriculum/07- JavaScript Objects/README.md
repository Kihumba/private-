# Outcome 7- JavaScript Objects

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can describe how objects in JavaScript differ from many other programming languages. On a practical level, they can leverage the power of objects in JavaScript to create more complex, rich applications. 


## Output
- **Task:** Create a JavaScript program that represents a real-world object and manipulates it in a way that solves a real-world problem (Examples to get you started: clock program; reading list; volume calculator)
- **Resources:** Make sure you construct your objects in a way where the properties are easily accessed. 
- **Include:** N/A

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to pass a collection of data from one place to another, **Action:** I use objects. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to create a container for named values in my code, **Action:** I create an object. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to create an object that I already have parameters for, **Action:** I use a constructor. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am creating an object that I can add properties and fields to after it has been constructed, **Action:** I use an initializer. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I create an object, **Action:** I define its properties. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to display the contents of an object on my screen, **Action:** I use methods. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to reference an object’s properties or methods, **Action:** I use the `this` keyword. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I know the name of the property I am trying to access in my program, **Action:** I use the dot operator `.` to read the object property. | [ ] | [ ] |  
| **Context:** When I don’t know the name of the property I am trying to access but I can compute it, **Action:** I use the computed property keys to read the object property. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When the name of a property I want to access has a space in it, I use bracket notation. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I am iterating through lists of an object’s properties,  I use a variable to access the properties. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I need to control how outside code can use information about an object, I create a private property. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I want to abstract or localize a specific set of functionalities on an object, I use encapsulation. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I want to iterate over an array, I use `.map`. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I want to condense arrays, I use `.reduce`. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| JavaScript has an eccentric take on objects as compared with classical OOP techniques. | [ ] | [ ] |
| An object is just a container that gathers together some data and some behavior. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Most things in Javascript are objects-- from strings to arrays to browser APIs. | [ ] | [ ] |
