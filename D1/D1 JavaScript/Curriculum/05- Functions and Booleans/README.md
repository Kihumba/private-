# Outcome 5- Functions and Booleans

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can write clean, powerful JavaScript code that executes specific tasks through the use of functions. 

## Output 
- **Task:** Write a JavaScript program that uses functions to models a real world problem. (Examples to get you started: Card Counter, Temperature Converter, Age Calculatorâ€¦)
- **Resources:** Use clean, efficient functions of the proper scope. 
- **Include:** N/A

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I write a line of code that creates an action I will want to repeat at other points in my program, **Action:** I create a function. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I define a function, **Action:** I also define one or more parameters that will be passed into it. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I am naming a function, **Action:** I try to make the name clearly represent what action it is responsible for. | [ ] | [ ] |  
| **Context:** When I want to write a function that has only two outputs- true or false-, **Action:** I write a predicate function. | [ ] | [ ] |  
| **Context:** When I am working with multiple callbacks in JavaScript, **Action:** I use Promises to tidy up my code. | [ ] | [ ] |  
| **Context:** When I am structuring my code, **Action:** I avoid multiple arguments or long functions and prefer passing objects as arguments to simulate named parameters. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
