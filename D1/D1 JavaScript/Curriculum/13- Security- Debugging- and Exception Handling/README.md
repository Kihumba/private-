# Outcome 13- Security, Debugging, and Exception Handling

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can ensure security on both the client and server side of their Javascript application. They can use exception handling in their code, and can use debugging tools to continually test their program. 

## Output
- **Task:** Using a JavaScript web app program you have worked on in the past, build in exception handling and security. 
- **Resources:** Use XSS for your security, and justify any other security measures you feel are appropriate. 
- **Include:** Let a colleague try to crack your security or exceptions to see how you did!

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am writing JavaScript applications, **Action:** I avoid using ‘eval’ as it can open my code for injections and attacks. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am extra concerned with the security of my code, **Action:** I use strict mode to opt into a restricted variant of Javascript. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to prevent cookie theft, **Action:** I set HttpOnly flag on cookies. 
| **Context:** Whenever I fix a bug, **Action:** I write a regression test. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When my input source is an output from a different programming language, **Action:** I use the ‘try/catch’ block for exception handling. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I use any form of synchronism, **Action:** I use the ‘try/catch’ block for exception handling. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to use DevTools for debugging, **Action:** I access them from Google Chrome and run my code in the DevTools window. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I throw an exception in my JavaScript program, **Action:** I specify the expression containing the value to be thrown. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| No matter what testing framework you use, you should be using tests. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I am cautious about stubs and mocks as they can make my tests more brittle. | [ ] | [ ] |
| 100% test coverage is a good goal to strive for, even if it’s not always practical to reach it. | [ ] | [ ] |
