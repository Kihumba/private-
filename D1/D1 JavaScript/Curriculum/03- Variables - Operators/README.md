# Outcome 3- Variables & Operators 

## Skill Description
A person with this skill uses JavaScript operators to declare variables in their program. They follow variable naming conventions and scope their variables appropriately for their goals.  

## Output: 
- **Task:** Create a simple JavaScript app that runs in the console, and which solves a real-world problem. 
- **Resources:** Create and appropriately name variables in a way that maps to their function. 
- **Include:** N/A

## Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am naming a variable, **Action:** I pay attention to whether I am using upper-case or lower-case letters to be compatible with JavaScript’s case-sensitivity. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want a variable to be accessible to any other code in my program, **Action:** I create a global variable. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want a variable available only within one function, **Action:** I declare a local variable within that function. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to declare a variable that is only available in one function, **Action:** I use the `let` keyword. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to declare a variable that is never intended to change, **Action:** I use the `const` keyword. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am initializing a variable, **Action:** I use the assignment operator to assign them a value. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to concatenate a string, **Action:** I use the `+` operator. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to append a variable to a literal, **Action:** I use the ‘+=’ Operator. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to prevent type coercion, **Action:** I use the `===` operator. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |

## Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Operators are not only useful for math and numbers, they can be used for a wide range of uses in JavaScript. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Variables are containers into which I can place and hold values in my program. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
