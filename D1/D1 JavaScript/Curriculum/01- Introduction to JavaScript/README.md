### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The benefit to the robust JavaScript community is that there are lots of libraries and documentations available. The drawback is that many are meaningless or overly complex. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I can dig through the noise of the good, mediocre, and bad JavaScript documentation that exists and find the gems that answer my questions.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| JavaScript is the language of the web-- If I am a web developer, I cannot escape it. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Because I can’t escape JavaScript, I may as well master it. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
