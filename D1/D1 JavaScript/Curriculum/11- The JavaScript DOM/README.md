# Outcome 11- The JavaScript DOM

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can describe how the DOM allows their JavaScript code to run in a web page. They can explain the HTML “tree” of objects and how they allow code to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements. 

## Output
- **Task:** Draw a diagram representing the DOM and how it works with your JavaScript code. 
- **Resources:** Use whatever medium you feel is most appropriate.
- **Include:** Share with a fellow programmer to discuss how well your diagram captures the nuances of the DOM.
