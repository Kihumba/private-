### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am writing a program that requires persistent connection from the browser to the server, **Action:** I consider using Node.js. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to use Node.js libraries and modules, **Action:** I first install the latest version of Node.js.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After I have the latest version of Node.js, **Action:** I update npm to insure I have its latest version. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to install a Node.js module, **Action:** I use the npm `init` function.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have created a Node.js module, **Action:** I run a test to ensure it is working how I expected.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to provide error handling in my callback, **Action:** I use promises through the `Q module` in Node.js. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I need to handle raw binary data in my Node.js application, **Action:** I use buffers. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I am using streams in Node.js, **Action:** I make sure I know what version of Node.js I am using to ensure I am working with the appropriate Node Stream API. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I want to be able to pause and resume my stream, **Action:** I use `readable` streams. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Node.js is not a silver bullet for every problem-- it is a framework that I can use for a particular need. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Using Node.js for heavy computation will annul all of its (many) advantages. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| Node.js shines when building fast, scalable network applications. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| With Node.js, I can handle a huge number of simultaneous connections with high throughput (thus high scalability).  | [ ] | [ ] |
