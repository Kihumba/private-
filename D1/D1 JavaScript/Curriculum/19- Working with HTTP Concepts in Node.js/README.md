# Outcome 19- Working with HTTP Concepts in Node.js

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can use Node.js to work with RESTful APIs, Routing, and Web Services.


## Output 
- **Task:** Build RESTful API that gets information about fake “clients” from a database, and allows you to create, read, update, and delete information about each of them.
- **Resources:** Use Node.js as a framework.
- **Include:** N/A

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Whenever I transfer a document on a web application or make an AJAX request, **Action:** I am implicitly using HTTP. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to send an HTTP request, **Action:** I first import HTTP providers into the root of my application file. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I create my API, **Action:** I set up my server using npm. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When setting up my server, **Action:** I define the routes for my API and apply them to a root URL. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have started a server, **Action:** I test it from the command line to make sure it is running. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to organize interactions between independent systems in the simplest way possible, **Action:** I use a RESTful API structure. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want something to happen every time a request is sent to my API, **Action:** I declare a middleware. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| By following shared syntax conventions for building APIs, I can increase productivity and take advantage of generalized tooling. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Building RESTful web services is part art, part science. | [ ] | [ ] |
| In the most general sense, an API is simply how two applications work together. | [ ] | [ ] |
