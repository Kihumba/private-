# Outcome 21 - Functional Programming in JavaScript

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can write code using functions as building blocks. They can break down complex problems into pieces they can solve using smaller, simpler functions and can combine the smaller functions to solve the bigger problem.

## Output
- **Task:** Take a JavaScript program you have worked on previously, and refactor it using Functional Programming methods. 
- **Resources:** Reflect on the changes in writing-- how does the code look different? How efficient is it? 
- **Include:** N/A

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am writing JavaScript code using functional programming methods, **Action:** I break down my code into small, composable functions. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When writing JavaScript code, **Action:** I use inbuilt functions that avoid mutating data. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have a function that expects multiple parameters, **Action:** I curry it. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I’m writing higher order functions that manipulate data, **Action:** I pass in the data last to enhance composability.
| **Context:** When I have to manipulate data in functionally programmed JavaScript, **Action:** I use collection-iteration functions instead of using a `forLoop`. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When writing JavaScript functions, **Action:** I ensure my functions are pure and referentially transparent. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need impure functionality in my code, **Action:** I write pure wrappers around the impure functionality. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Functional programming helps me write code that is simple and expressive. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Functional programming results in code that is easy to understand, reuse, test, refactor, maintain, and reason about. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Functional programming does require discipline to write, but it is well worth it.  |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
