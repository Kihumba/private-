# Outcome 9- JavaScript Objects

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can explain how objects in JavaScript differ from objects in many other programming languages, and how that impacts how they can be used in JavaScript programs. On a practical level, they can leverage the power of objects in JavaScript to create more complex, rich applications. 


## Output
- **Task:** Create a JavaScript program that solves a real-world problem (Examples to get you started: clock program; reading list; volume calculator, etc.)
- **Resources:** Make sure you construct your objects in a way where the properties are easily accessible. 
- **Include:** N/A

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to pass a collection of data from one place to another, **Action:** I use objects. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to create a container for named values in my code, **Action:** I create an object. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to create an object that I already have parameters for, **Action:** I use a constructor. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to be able to add properties and fields to an object after it has been constructed, **Action:** I use an initializer. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I create an object, **Action:** I define its properties right away. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to display the contents of an object, **Action:** I use methods. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to reference an object’s properties or methods, **Action:** I use the `this` keyword. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I know the name of the property I am trying to access in my program, **Action:** I use the dot operator `.` to read the object property. | [ ] | [ ] |  
| **Context:** When I don’t know the name of the property I am trying to access but I can compute it, **Action:** I use the computed property keys to read the object property. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When the name of a property I want to access has a space in it, **Action:** I use bracket notation. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I am iterating through lists of an object’s properties, **Action:** I use a variable to access the properties. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I need to control how outside code can use information about an object, **Action:** I create a private property. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I want to abstract or localize a specific set of functionalities on an object, **Action:** I use encapsulation. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I want to iterate over an array, **Action:** I use `.map`. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I want to condense arrays, **Action:** I use `.reduce`. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Most things in JavaScript are objects-- from strings to arrays to browser APIs. | [ ] | [ ] |
| JavaScript has an eccentric take on objects as compared with classical OOP techniques. | [ ] | [ ] |
| An object is just a container that gathers together some data and some behavior. | [ ] | [ ] |
