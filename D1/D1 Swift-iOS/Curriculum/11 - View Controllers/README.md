# Outcome 11 - View Controllers
## Skill Description

A person with this skill can use View Controllers with its varying implementations to create Lists, Collections or just simple scenes with UI Views, as well as passing data to View Controllers before they appear on the screen and scripting the behavior of the Controllers.

## Output

Create an iOS project with a View Controller embedded in a Navigation Controller, that navigates between 3 view controllers by tapping buttons.

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to split the View Controllers into tabs for easy navigation using the `UITabBar`, **Action:** I use the Tab Bar Controller and its associated classes | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to navigate between two or more View Controllers, **Action:** I use the Navigation Controller and its associated classes | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to display a list of items of similar type, **Action:** I should make use of a Table View Controller and its associated classes | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to pass data to a View Controller,  **Action:** I override the `prepareForSegue` function and assign the data accordingly | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to display a list of items of varying type and layout, **Action:** I use a Collection View Controller and its associated classes | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to add custom code functionality to my View Controller Scene, **Action:** I implement an appropriate View Controller class and reference it in the Scene. | [ ] | [ ] |
