# Outcome 3 - Data types
## Skill Description

A person with this skill can identify and use the Data types available in Swift, as well as create collections of these data types.

## Output

Create the a  Swift Playground Application that includes a function that prints the data types of the arguments that were passed.

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to create, reference or manipulate data, **Action:** I use the most appropriate data type that best suits that data | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I create a custom data type, **Action:** I use `typealias` to to make it easy to reference | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to process a collection of Data, **Action:** I use the `.forEach` function when available, otherwise I use a normal loop | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I create a variable / constant, **Action:** I explicitly set the Data type, to make it clear what the data is used for | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I create a collection, **Action:**, I use only one Data type with that collection | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When creating a variable that is allowed to have no value i.e. `nil`, **Action:** I use Optionals, which allows the variable exist as `nil` even after assigning it a value | [  ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
