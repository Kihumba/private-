# Outcome 1 - Setting up and Getting Started
## Skill Description

A person with this skill can use variables and constants where required to create a basic an iOS app, and can alter the flow of a program using the appropriate control flow statement.

## Output

Create a basic program in Swift Playground that uses variables and constants to process an input and produce a conditioned output.

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need a value reference that could change, **Action:** I create a variable | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When a value shouldn't change, **Action:** I always use a constant instead of a variable to represent it | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When defining variables or constants, **Action:** I use names that are descriptive of what the variables or constants contain | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have procedures to run that depend on a certain input or value, **Action:** I use a conditional expression to change which procedure is run | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have a collection of data to process, **Action:** I use a procedure inside the loop to repeat the operation for each item in the collection | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Appropriate use of variables and constants will make my application run efficiently | [ ] | [ ] |
| Using Loops when I need to repeat a procedure for a number of items in a collection will keep my code “DRY” | [ ] | [ ] |
| Conditional statements allow me condition an output based on a input | [ ] | [ ] |
