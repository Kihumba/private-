#Outcome 7- Ruby Code Organization, Modules, and Namespacing


Skill Description
----------
A person with this skill can explain why Rubyists are so passionate about well-organized code. They consistently use modules and namespacing to properly organize their Ruby code. 


Outputs
----------
- **Task:** Using code that’s already built (by you or by someone else) refactor it to optimize its namespacing and organization. 
- **Resources:** Use ‘include’ and ‘extend’ in your methods to optimize efficiency. 
- **Include:** Swap with a peer to give and receive feedback on the edits you made.

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to namespace my code, **Action:** I use modules to prevent naming conflict. | [ ] | [ ]  | 
| **Context:** When I want to make a method available to an instance of a class, **Action:** I use ‘include’. | [ ] | [ ]  | 
| **Context:** When I want to make a method available to the class itself, **Action:** I use ‘extend’. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to group together methods, classes and constants, **Action:** I use a module. | [ ] | [ ]  | 
| **Context:** When I want to reuse a class later in my code, **Action:** I include a module in it. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When using mixins, **Action:** I am careful with the order of my ‘include’ calls to avoid the potential pitfall of shadowing my methods. | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| If I want my code to scale, I must be well organized.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Pretty code is functional code-- it is easier to add features, fix bugs, and get new developers up to speed.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
