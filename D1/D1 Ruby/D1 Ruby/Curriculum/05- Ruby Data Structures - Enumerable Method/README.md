#Outcome 5- Ruby Data Structures & Enumerable Methods

Skill Description
----------
A person with this skill will be able to use Ruby data structures to design and build efficient applications. By using the right data structures at the right time, a Ruby developer can search, organize, and manipulate information in their application, even while reducing the complexity of their code. 

Outputs
----------
- **Task:** Create a Ruby program that use Enumerable methods to manipulate the contents of a collection of data
- **Resources:** Use either hashes or arrays (or both) as your collection of data.
- **Include:** N/A

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I have sequential data, **Action:** I use an Array. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have data that is labeled using paired keys and values, **Action:** I use a Hash. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am using an array, **Action:** I keep in mind that they are indexed starting at zero. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am iterating over an array, **Action:** I use ‘for’ or ‘each’ loops. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am iterating over a hash, **Action:** I use the ‘each’ method. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have a collection that I want to work with (arrays or hashes), **Action:** I use an enumerable method. | [ ] | [ ]  |
