# Output 05- Reflect on your Testing

- **The Product:** Write a short blog post about your experience testing Mozilla’s new products. You can focus on what you learned, the bugs you found, or the concept of open-source testing more generally.  <br>
- **The Process:** If you have a personal blog, LinkedIn account, or other blog you contribute to, share it there-- you might even get Mozilla’s attention if you tag them!  <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** Learning is never solidified without reflection. Knowledge gained is more valuable when shared! (Oh, and you might get Mozilla's attention enough to win their recognition and prizes...)
