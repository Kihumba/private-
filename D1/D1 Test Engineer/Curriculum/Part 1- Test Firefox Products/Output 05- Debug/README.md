# Output 05- Debug

- **The Product:**  Debug one or more of the bugs you filed for Mozilla. 
- **The Process:**  Track your bugs in a bug tracking tool, and include a written bug report/status report. 
- **The Follow-Through:** Mozilla uses these to improve their products, and you could even get featured in their blog or win cool prizes (think, trips to Mozilla conferences) if you provide a ton of valuable bug files & fixes!

>> 1. Does this sound too easy? Don’t get bored, you can always test [Mozilla’s new Android features](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/android/) or their [iOS Test Flight program](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/android/)!
>> 2. Does this sound challenging? Great! Get to work, using the below KBB’s and resource links to help as needed. 
>>  3. Does this sound like gibberish? You may not be ready for this task. Read through some of the resources on bug reporting, or ask a colleague to see some reports they have written.

| **Knowledge**	| 
| How to identify failure points | 
| </br> | 
| **Behaviors** 	| 
|  **Context:** When I come across a bug in a program, **Action:** I first try to replicate the problem from another angle to figure out the severity of the bug. |  
| **Context:** When I have determined that I can replicate the problem, **Action:** I gradually break down the broken part of the process and test each smaller piece to identify where the core issue or “failure point” is. |
| **Context:** Once I have determined the “failure point,” **Action:** I use methodical “trial and error” experimentation to narrow in on what is breaking that point.  |  
| </br> | 
| **Beliefs**	| 
| Debugging isn’t something you can learn by reading about it-- it must be learned through experience.  |  
| An effective debugger is part detective, part puzzle master. |
