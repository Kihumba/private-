# Output 03- Write an Integrations Test

- **The Product:** In the world of “nonfunctional” testing, that is, testing for code quality rather than user interaction, integrations tests are some of the most important forms of testing you’ll do.   <br>
- **The Process:** Write an integration test on a program (either within or outside of Andela) that uses loops to iterate through different events. Inspect how effective the code is, how long it will take a condition to go through the different stages, and the output that results in the system.   <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** You’ll want to speak with the development team to determine which areas are the most important to focus on for integration testing.
