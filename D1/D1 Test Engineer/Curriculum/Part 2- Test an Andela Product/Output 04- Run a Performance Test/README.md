# Output 04- Run a Performance Test

- **The Product:** On most websites, you can run basic performance tests right in the browser. Test the load that your favorite website can handle, and what it is managing currently.    <br>

- **The Follow-Through:** Make sure you communicate your report in a way that both developers and non-technical audiences can understand. Submit this to your team, or send it to the website in question! You never know if it might be just what they needed.
