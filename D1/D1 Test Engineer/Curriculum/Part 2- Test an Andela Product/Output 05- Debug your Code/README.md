# Output 05- Debug your Code

- **The Product:** There are always opportunities to practice effective debugging. <br>
- **The Process:** Reach out to any program at Andela (or outside Andela) and offer to debug their program.  <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** Log any bugs you find in a bug tracking tool, and include a written bug report/status report. 

-----------------------------------------------------------
>> Find your ZPD (["Zone of Proximal Development"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development)): 
>> 
>> 1. Does this sound too easy? Don’t get bored, reflect on your debugging experiences ([Output 5b](https://github.com/andela/learningmap/tree/new-structure/D1/D1%20Test%20Engineer/Curriculum/Part%202-%20Test%20an%20Andela%20Product/Output%2005b-%20Refactor))
>> 2. Does this sound challenging? Great! Get to work, using the below KBB’s and resource links to help as needed. 
>>  3. Does this sound like gibberish? You may not be ready for this task. Read through a few best-practices documents (below) or pair with a more senior developer to observe them debugging their code-- all developers will debug at some point, so you should be able to find someone easily!

| **"KBB's"** <br> _What do experts think, do, and feel as they work through this task?_|
|----------|
| </br>| 
| **Knowledge**	| 
| Format for how to write a bug report	|  
| How to communicate bugs to both technical and non-technical stakeholders	|  
| How and why an engineer should track a bug	|  
| How to assign priority level to a tracked bug	|  
| Benefits and drawbacks of various bug tracking tools, and how to use at least one	|  
| How to identify failure points	|  
| </br> | 
| **Behaviors** 	| 
|  **Context:** When I come across a bug in a program, **Action:** I first try to replicate the problem from another angle to figure out the severity of the bug.  	|  
|  **Context:** When I have determined that I can replicate the problem, **Action:** I gradually break down the broken part of the process and test each smaller piece to identify where the core issue or “failure point” is.  	|  
|  **Context:** When I find a bug in a program, **Action:** I determine its severity and assign it a priority level to determine how immediately it needs to get fixed. 	|  
| </br> | 
| **Beliefs**	| 
| Debugging isn’t something you can learn by reading about it-- it must be learned through experience. |  
| An effective debugger is part detective, part puzzle master. |
