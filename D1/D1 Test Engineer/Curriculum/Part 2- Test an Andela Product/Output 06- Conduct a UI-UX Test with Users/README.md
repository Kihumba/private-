# Output 06- Conduct a UI/UX Test with Users

- **The Product:** On an internal Andela product (or external product) run a UI/UX Testing session with real users. Try to keep your session specific to one feature. For example, you may want to test how Users interact with the navigation bar of a particular product.   <br>
- **The Process:** Use both observation and interview questions to gather feedback from users as they test the product.   <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** Finalize your project with an analysis of your findings-- remember to include the kinds of users, number of participants, findings, and feature or function suggestions that emerged according to user needs
