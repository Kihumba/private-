# Output 01- Write a Test Plan & Test Scenarios

- **The Product:** The first step in testing a is to write a test plan. Find a product that you’ll be testing (within Andela or outside) and meet with the development team. During this meeting you’ll want to collect system requirements, determine who they are building for, what the main features are, how those features are supposed to work, and what the specific requirements are for making that work. Formulate several “user stories” with the team based on these requirements and features. Carefully document what you gather from your conversation.  <br>
- **The Process:** Now, it’s time to translate this information into a finalized test strategy document. In this document, include the test scenarios and test cases within the scenario, overall testing strategy, and an estimate for the amount of time you believe it will take.  <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** And remember who you’re testing for-- send this document to your development team for review, and get their feedback on the clarity and completeness of your documentation. They might catch something that you’ve missed and save you hours of work down the road!

| **Knowledge**	| 
| Reasons to write a test plan 	|  
| Components and format of a well-written test plan |

| **Behaviors** 	| 
|  **Context:** When I am preparing to test a new product, **Action:** I start by meeting with the development team to understand the requirements and features of the product.	|  
| **Context:** Once I have the requirements and features of the product, **Action:** I write user stories to illustrate how the features should function. |
| **Context:** After I have compiled all of the information about a product’s features and functionalities, **Action:** I write a Test Plan to outline my test scenarios and steps.   |  
| </br> | 
| **Beliefs**	| 
| Trying to test without a test plan is like jumping into development without knowing what you’re trying to build.  |  
| A little extra research about the product I am testing up front can save me hours of unnecessary work when I start testing.|
