# Output 02- Use your Test Plan to Test a Feature

- **The Product:** Now that you have a plan, time to put it into action! <br>
- **The Process:** Test a feature to ensure that it is working how you expect. For example, you may test a login feature with two input fields, User Name and Password. When you enter the User Name, is it validating the kind of format it should be expecting? When you enter the password, what should happen? Where in the application should you go if the password is correct? What kind of error message should the user see if it is not correct?  <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** Use a tool of your choice to test, document, and report your bugs to the development team.
