# Output 1- Build an Application with Angular and Node

- **The Product:** Take a look at Firefox Nightly, Mozilla’s new product ([Check out the details here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/#nightly)). Get to know the product, try it out yourself, read release documents, and identify areas of the product that will need testing.   <br>
- **The Process:** Write a test case document outlining the area you plan on testing and your test strategy.   <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** File this in TestRail so that Mozilla’s developers can understand what you are testing for and how you are approaching it.

| **"KBB's"** <br> _What do experts think, do, and feel as they work through this task?_|
|----------|
| </br>| 
| **Knowledge**	| 
| Reasons to write a test plan 	|  
| Components and format of a well-written test plan | 
| How to leverage user stories to inform test scenarios	|
| </br> | 
| **Behaviors** 	| 
|  **Context:** When I am preparing to test a new product and I do not have access to the development team, **Action:** I start reading about the product, looking at its codebase, and outlining what the product is meant to accomplish.  	|  
| **Context:** Once I have the requirements and features of the product, **Action:** I write user stories to illustrate how the features should function. 	|
| **Context:** After I have compiled all of the information about a product’s features and functionalities, **Action:** I write a Test Plan to outline my test scenarios and steps.  |  
| </br> | 
| **Beliefs**	| 
| Trying to test without a test plan is like jumping into development without knowing what you’re trying to build.  |  
| A little extra research about the product I am testing up front can save me hours of unnecessary work when I start testing.|
