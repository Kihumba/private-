# Estimating

## Skill Description
A person with this skill is able to systematically break down work into individual tasks and provide estimates on each to ultimately derive an estimate on the LOE/time required to complete the work.  They should also be able to defend how they came up with the estimate.   (Estimates at this stage are not expected to be 100% accurate.)
