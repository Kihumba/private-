# Requirements Analysis

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can clearly explain the big picture of how their work impacts their client, the application they are working on and the end user of the product.   They incorporate their understanding to ask questions to better flesh out the feature and ensure that the changes they make address all these factors rather than strictly implementing requests as specified.
