# Test Driven Development

## Skill Description
A person with this skill is fluent in the concepts behind test driven development and can demonstrate them in practice.

The Fellow should know:
1. What to test:
- Public methods of the unit
- All branches of code execution within the unit
- For units that have direct user exposure (such as controllers in an MVC framework) unexpected inputs that a user may use to break the system
2. What not to test:
- Interaction between the tested unit and another unit
- Correct behavior of underlying libraries
- Unmodified boilerplate code (including generated scaffolds)
3. What to stub:
- Behaviors of other units (including external applications and libraries) that are necessary for this unit to function
