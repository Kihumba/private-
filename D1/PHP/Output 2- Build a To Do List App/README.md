| **Context:** When I am planning out a PHP program **Action:** I first write out the stakeholder expectations and the app structure in “plain English.” | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am writing a program in PHP **Action:** I plan not only to get my code working now, but also write out an edge case analysis of any issues that could arise in the future. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have written my PHP program plan in English **Action:** I then “translate” that to smaller pieces that I can create in PHP and compose Unit Tests for each. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have determined the key pieces of my PHP app **Action:** I build one small piece at a time, testing and refactoring as I go. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:**  When I need to create, reference, or manipulate data **Action:** I simply assign the value to a variable and let PHP automatically detect the type. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
