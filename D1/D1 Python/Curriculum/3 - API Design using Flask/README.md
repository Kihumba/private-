# Outcome 3 - API Design using Flask

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow will be able to use Flask as a Python framework for creating web applications. 


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create a simple application using Flask (eg. a simple bucket list application where users can register, sign in and create their bucket list).

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When creating routes for my Flask API **Action:** I properly specify the methods I would like the view function to accept. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When creating view functions for my Flask API **Action:** I use the `request.method` variable to handle different request methods to the same url. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When creating links between API methods I define **Action:** I use the `url_for()` function to create easily readable references to different view functions within my codebase. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to access data sent to my API from my client **Action:** I access it through the `request` object. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to access data sent to my API from my client **Action:** I determine whether to use `request.args`, `request.json` or `request.forms` depending on how the data is sent. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to create a custom response object **Action:** I use the `make_response()` function to create the response object before returning it. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to output JSON from my view function **Action:** I convert to JSON using the `jsonify()` function. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to persist data across a session **Action:** I add it to the Flask `session` dictionary. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to validate multiple values at once **Action:** I use Flask-WTF forms to create validation rules to ensure data is sanitized. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When creating Flask-WTF forms **Action:** I ensure to take advantage of the various field types and parameters to properly specify the data I'm expecting from my client. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to validate fields in my form **Action:** I use the `validate_on_submit()` function for the form. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When there's an error during runtime in my Flask API **Action:** I make use of the `abort()` function to stop the current request cycle. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I anticipate that I will encounter an error multiple times during application execution **Action:** I create custom error handlers as functions decorated with `@app.errorhandler()` to respond to specific HTTP status codes. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to model data to be used in my Flask API **Action:** I make use of SQLAlchemy to define data models. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I run my application **Action:** I ensure to run `create_all()` at least once to ensure my database is constructed from my models. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to refresh my database to reflect the new changes in my models **Action:** I ensure to run `drop_all()` to delete the entire database and `create_all() to recreate it`. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When creating data models using SQLAlchemy **Action:** I ensure to use the right field types specific to the data being stored in the database. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to create Foreign key relationships between fields **Action:** I use the `ForeignKey` class and the `backref` attribute to specify the relationship. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to indicate a field as primary key **Action:** I specify `primary_key=True` when constructing the field using the `Column` class. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to access data from my view functions **Action:** I query the database using the SQLAlchemy data models and its functions. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to make frequent changes to my data model **Action:** I use migrations to ensure that my database structure is continuously updated. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When my API is returning a lot of data **Action:** I paginate the records coming back to the client. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I'm writing test for my flask application **Action:** I create a test client within my `setUp()` function. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to test the different endpoints in my API **Action:** I use the functions provided by the test client object to make HTTP requests to the test app. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When writing tests for my Flask API **Action:** I test all the API endpoints using varying parameter types. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When writing tests for my Flask API **Action:** I test exceptional cases. | [ ] | [ ] |
