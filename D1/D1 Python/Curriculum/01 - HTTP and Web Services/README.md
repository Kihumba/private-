# Outcome 1 - HTTP and Web Services

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow will have a foundational understanding of HTTP and web services, including HTTP protocol, REST, and consuming APIs. 

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to build an app that consumes an API using the `requests` library.

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When working with an API **Action:** I always read the documentation extensively to get familiar with the different endpoints and corresponding parameters. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When testing with an API **Action:** I make use of [POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com/) or [Httpie](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie). | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making an HTTP request **Action:** I specify the resource I am trying to access using the URL. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have gotten a response from an HTTP request that I made **Action:** I always inspect the response status code and message to get adequate situational information. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making an HTTP request to a RESTful API **Action:** I indicate the function I'm trying to access via the corresponding HTTP verbs.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making an HTTP `GET` request **Action:** I specify parameters within the URI (after the question mark). | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making an HTTP `GET` request **Action:** I separate multiple `GET` parameters using the `&` sign. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making an HTTP `POST` or `PUT` request to a RESTful API **Action:** I specify parameters within the request body. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When making an HTTP request **Action:** I define the operating parameters of the HTTP transaction within the header of the request | [ ] | [ ] |

| Before diving into the specifics of a programming language I must first understand its interactions with the surrounding web environment. | [ ] | [ ]  |
