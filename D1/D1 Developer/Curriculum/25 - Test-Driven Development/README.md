# Outcome 25 - Test-Driven Development

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands and applies the concepts behind test-driven development.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

1. A project built using test-driven development


**Objectives**
----------
## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |
| The benefits of test-driven development | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The process of test-driven development | [ ] | [ ]  |
| How to predict edge cases and unexpected inputs | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Common frameworks that enable test-driven development | [ ] | [ ]  |



----------


## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before I implement software requirements **Action:** I write tests that specifically describe the software requirements | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I write tests **Action:** I write tests for edge cases and unexpected inputs | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After writing failing tests that describe the problem I'm trying to solve **Action:** I write the actual programming solution to make the tests pass | [ ] | [ ] |
| | | |


----------


## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| To write effective tests, I must clearly understand the feature's specification and requirements | [ ] | [ ] |
| Test-driven development is a gateway to writing modularized, flexible, and extensible code | [ ] | [ ] |
| Programmers that write more tests are more productive | [ ] | [ ] |
| Test-driven development eliminates my subconscious tendency to write tests that I know will pass | [ ] | [ ] |
| Testing for edge cases and unexpected inputs makes my code more robust and rock solid | [ ] | [ ] |
