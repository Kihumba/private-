# Outcome 37 - End-to-End Testing

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands the importance of end-to-end testing. The Fellow can apply end-to-end testing to test system dependencies and ensure data integrity across an application.

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

1. A project with robust end-to-end tests


**Objectives**

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I write end-to-end test scenarios **Action:** I write scenarios for all happy paths and sad paths | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before writing an end-to-end test script **Action:** I manually test the app from the UI and confirm that all expected data changes have been captured in the data layer as shown in the UI | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before writing an end-to-end test script for a given software component **Action:** I record all system dependencies of the software component | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When writing end-to-end test scripts for a given software component **Action:** I write tests to cover interactions of the component and its system dependencies | [ ] | [ ] |

----------


## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I am the first line of quality assurance for any product I build | [ ] | [ ] |
| Testing for system dependencies prepares my application for real world use  | [ ] | [ ] |
| I create value by writing end-to-end tests because it simulates the experience of my user  | [ ] | [ ] |
