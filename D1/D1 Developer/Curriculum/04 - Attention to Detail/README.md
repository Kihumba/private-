# Outcome 4 - Attention to Detail


## Skill Description

The Fellow understands the importance of reviewing outputs (e.g. code committed, emails sent, slack messages, development environment setup, UI's created) to ensure they meet standards and expectations. They understand the importance of carefully reviewing requests and ensuring that they address everything that is being requested. They pay attention to the context of the problem, and are able to create thorough solutions that address the entire issue and any corresponding issues.
