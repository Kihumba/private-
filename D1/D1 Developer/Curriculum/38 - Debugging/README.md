# Outcome 38 - Debugging

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands the basics of debugging, including how to replicate the problem and gradually break down the process into simpler components to isolate the root cause of the defect.

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able create do the following:

1. A log of bugs I have fixed on a project and how I fixed them


**Objectives**
----------
## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before I start fixing a bug **Action:** I replicate the problem | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I begin fixing a bug **Action:** I leverage debugging techniques to isolate the root cause of the problem | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After I identify the root cause of the problem **Action:** I note it down before making the appropriate changes to eliminate the root cause of the problem | [ ] | [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Programming is really just debugging | [ ] | [ ] |
| Addressing the root cause of a problem will keep it from repeating | [ ] | [ ] |
