# Outcome 10- Persistence & Data Storage

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can build an application that stores persistent application data. They can explain the various storage options that are available to an Android developer, and justify the use case for the one they are using. 

## Output
- **Task:** Create an Android application that remembers persisting user data (game scores, list items, etc.) 
- **Resources:** Choose an appropriate method of persistent data storage, and be able to explain why you chose the method you did. 
- **Include:** N/A

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Definition of persistent storage | [ ] | [ ] |
| Different storage options for application data and how to use them | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to save files on the Android device | [ ] | [ ] |
| Techniques for backing up data and how to implement the most effective one | [ ] | [ ] |

## Behavior

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When building an Android app where I need to save information for future retrieval **Action:** I make use of persistent storage. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have files that don’t require access restrictions, **Action:** I use external storage. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to be sure that neither the user nor other applications can access my application’s files, **Action:** I use internal storage. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want data to be accessible without a network connection, **Action:** I use internal storage. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:**  When I have an option between storing on a memory card or directly on a phone **Action:** I always opt to store on a memory card to avoid maxing out internal capacity. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I am downloading information from a server onto a user’s device **Action:** I build in user permissions so that the user has control over allowing that data onto their phone. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |

| A user should be the gatekeeper to the data allowed into their phone. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| If my application can store and retrieve data effectively, I have made it powerful. | [ ] | [ ]  |
