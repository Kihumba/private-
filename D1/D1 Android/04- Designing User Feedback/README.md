### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When my app needs to provide feedback to users **Action:** I use Android dialogs, Toasts, or snackbar. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When adding components to my Android app **Action:**  I ensure that I capture the event for that component. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am creating common input controls and layout models **Action:** I use the collection of ‘View’ and ‘ViewGroup’ objects | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want my app to look consistent across many types of devices **Action:** I use a relative layout. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When designing my Android app, **Action:** I build in constant feedback so that the user always knows what the results of their interactions are. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Components are only useful when I write code for the events they listen for. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| User Feedback is the doorway to the functionality of my application. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Interaction on an app is just like a conversation: If my app doesn’t have feedback after every interaction, it is as if the user asked me a question and I just stayed silent. | [ ] | [ ] |
