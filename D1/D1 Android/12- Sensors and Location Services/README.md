# Outcome 12- Sensors & Location Services

## Skill Description
A person with this skill makes effective use of sensors to enhance the user experience of their Android application. They thoughtfully integrate environmental variables when appropriate, and resist adding sensors when they will not markedly add to the effectiveness of their application. 

## Output
- **Task:** Create an Android application that allows a user to integrate the app into their physical everyday experience or environment in some creative way.  
- **Using:** Make use of sensors in a thoughtful manner (motion, position, location or other sensors) and be able to justify why that environmental aspect is critical to the UI of the application.
- **Include:** N/A

| **Context:** When developing an Android app **Action:** I consider whether the user experience could be enhanced by sensors. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When adding sensors to my Android app **Action:** I consider which specific sensor(s) are most appropriate to include in the application. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I add a sensor to my Android application, **Action:** I recognize that I am choosing a tradeoff of functionality at the expense of data and battery usage and plan accordingly. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When sensor activity pauses or is no longer needed in my application  **Action:** I unregister the sensor’s listeners to avoid overuse of battery and data resources. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** After adding a sensor to my application **Action:** I test it using the Android Emulator. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When working with location-based/map-based apps **Action:** I make use of the Android device GPS/Location tracker. | [ ] | [ ]  |
