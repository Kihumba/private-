# Outcome 9- Working with Databases

## Skill Description
A person with this skill is familiar with relational database concepts and can use APIs to access databases for their Android application. They can build well structured databases and optimized queries for their Android application. 

## Output: 
- **Task:** Build an android Application that uses a relational database to save and manage user data
- **Resources:** Inspect the database on the server side and structure your database to mirror theirs as closely as possible. Choose the library that will most effectively help you carry out the tasks you need it to. 
- **Include:** N/A

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am creating a relational table, **Action:** I ensure that the rows in the table are all distinct. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** After my application gets data from the server, **Action:** I need to store it in a database. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I am building a database for my application, **Action:** I mirror the structure of the database it is connecting to in the server as closely as possible. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am choosing a library/database, **Action:** I consider what I want my database to do, and which library will allow me to construct queries with the fewest lines of code. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When there is a change in a database on the server, **Action:** I set up my application to receive “push notifications” from the server without automatically downloading the new data. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need a temporary storage option, **Action:** I store my data in shared preferences. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
