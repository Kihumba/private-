# Output 07- Debug an Application

- **The Product:** No application is "complete" without debugging... and every application will have bugs! <br>
- **The Process:** Debug your PHP application, gradually breaking down the broken part of the process and testing each smaller piece to identify where the core issue or “failure point” is. <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** Log any bugs you find in a bug tracking tool, and include a written bug report/status report.
