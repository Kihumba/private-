# Output 08- Add Laravel Framework and Configure Authentication

- **The Product:** Create the data architecture to build a Laravel site for pet-sitting (watching someone's pet while they're gone). People can babysit for multiple pets and pets can have multiple petsitters.<br>
- **The Process:** You will need to write the necessary Eloquent queries for manipulating data from the database. Once you've gotten the architecture outlined, build the application, making sure to use migrations to evolve database schema over time. 
- **The Follow-Through:** Get real users to try out your app and make refactoring changes that they suggest!
