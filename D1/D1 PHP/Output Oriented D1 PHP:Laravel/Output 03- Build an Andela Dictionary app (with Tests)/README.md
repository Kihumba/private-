# Output 3 PHP Developer- "Build an Andela Dictionary App (with tests)"

Create a program that can add, retrieve, update, and delete Andelan words to a dictionary to help new members navigate the Andela Lexicon. 

Make your program Object Oriented so that aspects of your code can be reused later.  

Use PHPUnit to test your classes and functions at every step to make sure they do exactly what you want them to do.

## Behaviors
| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am planning out a PHP program **Action:** I first write out the stakeholder expectations and the app structure in “plain English.” | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am writing a program in PHP **Action:** I plan not only to get my code working now, but also write out an edge case analysis of any issues that could arise in the future. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have written my PHP program plan in English **Action:** I then “translate” that to smaller pieces that I can create in PHP and compose Unit Tests for each. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have determined the key pieces of my PHP app **Action:** I build one small piece at a time, testing and refactoring as I go. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:**  When I want to store one or more values in a single variable **Action:**  I make use of arrays.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:**  When I am getting started with my dictionary application **Action:** I create a class that holds a static array containing the dictionary words. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want a simple map value dataset **Action:** I use a ‘key,value’ array.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I have an array added **Action:** I create a second class/classes that can add, retrieve, update, and delete word meanings thrown in as arguments to the class functions. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am working with a list of values **Action:** I use Iterators to traverse the collection.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I am naming my classes, variables, or constants **Action:** I use names that are descriptive of what they contain. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |

| I write code as if I can see the future-- I am always prepared for the edge cases that might arise. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Using variables and constants appropriately makes my programs more efficient and readable.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
