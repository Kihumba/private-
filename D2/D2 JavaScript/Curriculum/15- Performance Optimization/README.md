# Outcome 15- Performance Optimization 

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can test and optimize their code’s performance, both for Node.js and client-side JavaScript. They consistently prevent memory leaks in their code.

Output
-**Task:** Run some JavaScript code in your browser and analyze its runtime performance. 
-**Resources:** Use the network and profiler tabs to examine possible inefficiencies, and refactor your code until you have increased the runtime speed. 
-**Include:** N/A

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before running any test application, **Action:** I open the network tab.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to inspect web traffic to see how my application interacts with online services, **Action:** I use the network tab.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to examine how long a function takes to run in my browser, **Action:** I look at the profiler tab.   | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When my application’s performance is not up to the standards I want, **Action:** I check whether there could be a long running function or a memory leak.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want my code to run on any device (old computers, mobile), **Action:** I run tests to make sure that parsing and rendering are optimized.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am optimizing my code’s performance, **Action:** I break it up into components that are as small and simple as possible so that any server can run it.  | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The Profiler and Network tabs in my browser allow me to hunt down and annihilate inefficiencies in my code.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| A world class JavaScript developer balances performance and security.  [ ] | [ ] |
| The less code I write, the faster it will be.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| JavaScript gets ugly fast if I’m not careful, so I do whatever I can to make it less so. 
| I make my user interface as friendly as possible.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| I make my code as readable as possible.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| I continuously hunt for more readable solutions.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| Other languages are Bonsai trees that you trim precisely, JavaScript is a gnarly hedge that must be constantly debugged and performance optimized.  | [ ] | [ ] |
