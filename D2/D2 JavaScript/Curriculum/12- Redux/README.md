# Outcome 12- Redux

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can make use of the Redux library and the Flux pattern to create robust, scalable React applications. They are able to explain what Redux does well, where it falls short, and how to leverage common libraries to create a Redux-friendly ecosystem. 

## Output
- **Task:** Create a React application that allows users to create, edit, access, and delete data directly through the UI of your program. If you would prefer, you can refactor an existing program that does this, building in Flux architecture through Redux. 
- **Resources:** Download and configure Redux and any other libraries you might need. 
- **Include:** N/A

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I realize I only need a few parts of Redux, **Action:** I donâ€™t use it, and instead I just write my own parts that will create the functionality that I need. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I decide to use Redux, **Action:** I consider what other libraries I will need to use along with it to support the functionalities I am looking for. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to build an application that can scale, **Action:** I consider using Redux. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When my application has a large (or ever-growing) amount of data that it needs to keep track of, **Action:** I use Redux. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am using Redux as a library, **Action:** I keep in mind that it uses one-way data flow and therefore my data is immutable. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am programming in the mindset of one-way data flow, **Action:** I treat functions as data as well. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
