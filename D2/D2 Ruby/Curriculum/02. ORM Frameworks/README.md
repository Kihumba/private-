## Skill Description:

A fellow is able to understand, build and/or use ORM frameworks to interact with a database. 

## Output:
**Task:** Build a simple ORM framework in Ruby

### Knowledge:
| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| What is ORM (Object Relational Mapping)? | [ ] | [ ] |
| What are the advantages and disadvantages of ORM as a concept? | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to  use different ORM frameworks written in Ruby? | [ ] | [ ] |

### Behaviors:
| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
**Context:** When using ORM for building an application, **Action:** I let the code access objects rather than the database structure itself, using the mapping between the business model and the database. | [ ] | [ ] |


### Beliefs:
| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Changing a few lines of code in the database configuration adapter makes it work with another database. | [ ] | [ ] |
| ORM provides an abstraction which allows a developer to focus on their business logic, rather than complex database queries, resulting in a huge reduction of code and increase in efficiency of the developer. | [ ] | [ ] |
| It doesn't really matter which type of database you're using. Active Record smooths out all the differences between those databases for you so you don't have to think about it. | [ ] | [ ] |
| ORM supports concurrency, allowing multiple users to update the same set of data simultaneously. | [ ] | [ ] |
