# Ruby - Metaprogramming


## Skill Description:

A fellow is able to use metaclasses to build APIs and tools for others to use.


## Output:
**Task:** Design a domain-specific (DSL) language of your own, then use that DSL to write your app program.

|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to automatically insert a known method into a set of classes, **Action:** I simply code the method in a superclass and have all the classes in question inherit from it. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs:
| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Metaprogramming with Ruby, one can do in a few minutes what other languages may take hours to do. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Proper planning and application of the metaprogramming techniques enables one to write code that is DRYer, lighter, more intuitive and more scalable. | [ ] | [ ] |
