# Ruby - Regular Expressions

## Skill Description

A fellow is able to use Regular expressions as a powerful and standardized way of searching, replacing, and parsing text with complex patterns of characters.

## Output
**Task:** Using [Hacker Rank - RegEx](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/regex/re-introduction), perform the following RegEX practice challenges; Character Class, Repetitions, Grouping and Capturing, Backreferences, Assertions and Applications. Share your ranking results.

### Knowledge
| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| What is a regular expression? | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to use regular-expression modifiers to control various aspects of matching. | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to use the Regexp object. | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to use special escape sequences for common character classes. | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to use special character (metacharacter) classes. | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to use repetition metacharacters (quantifiers). | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to use parentheses for capturing text. | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to use parentheses for atomic grouping. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Behavior
| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When using metacharacters in a pattern, to match them literally, **Action:** I backslash-escape the metacharacter. | [ ] | [ ] |


### Belief
| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Any literal character you put in a regular expression matches itself in the string. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Pattern matching may be achieved by using =~ operator or #match method. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Patterns behave like double-quoted strings so can contain the same backslash escapes. | [ ] | [ ] |
| A character class is delimited with square brackets ([, ]) and lists characters that may appear at that point in the match. | [ ] | [ ] |
| A regexp can't use named backreferences and numbered backreferences simultaneously. | [ ] | [ ] |
