# Ruby - GUI Programming (Tk Guide)

## Skill Description:

A fellow is able to apply Ruby and Rails to build portable graphical user interfaces, primarily with a s standard Tk library.

## Output
**Task:** Create a main or root window (an instance of TkRoot), add widgets to it to build up the user interface, and then start the main event loop by calling Tk.mainloop.

| What is Tk? | [ ] | [ ] |
| What are the different types of Ruby/Tk Widget Classes?
| How to create a simple Tk application? | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to apply standard configuration options to any Ruby/Tk widget. | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to specify standard attributes such as sizes, colors, dimensions and fonts. | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to use entry widgets to get input, such as text strings, from the user of an application. | [ ] | [ ] |

| How to use Ruby/Tk to manage and handle event loop. | [ ] | [ ] |


### Behaviours:
| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to create a simple Tk Application, **Action:** I first create the main or root window (an instance of TkRoot), add widgets to it to build up the user interface, and then start the main event loop by calling Tk.mainloop. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When Iâ€™ve constructed widget object trees as models of what I want to see on the screen, **Action:** I then ask the tree to display itself by calling Tk.mainloop. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs:
| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Tk has the unique distinction of being the only cross-platform GUI. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Tk is the standard GUI for Ruby. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| Tk works along a composition model - that is, you start by creating a container (such as a TkFrame or TkRoot) and then create widgets (GUI components) that populate it. | [ ] | [ ] |
| All widgets have different configuration options. The options that are available depend upon the widget class of course. | [ ] | [ ] |
