# Ruby - Web Application Security 

## Skill Description: 

A fellow understand the major web application security flaws that are commonly exploited by malicious actors, and is able to apply mitigation techniques for security frameworks when building every level of the web application. 

## Output:
**Task:** Using a web application project you’re working on, perform security testing for the following web app vulnerabilities; Password cracking, URL manipulation through HTTP GET methods, SQL Injection and Cross Site Scripting (XSS)


### Knowledge:
| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| What is a “Web Application Vulnerability”?| [ ] | [ ] |
| What are the top 10 web application vulnerabilities?| [ ] | [ ] | 
| What is “XSS (Cross Site Scripting)” and does it work?| [ ] | [ ] |
| What is “SQL injection” and session hijacking, and how does it work? | [ ] | [ ] |
| What is “Spoofing”?| [ ] | [ ] |
| What is cross site request forgery?| [ ] | [ ] |
| How does URL manipulation through HTTP GET methods work? And how do you prevent it?| [ ] | [ ] |
| How do you prevent unauthorized access?| [ ] | [ ] |
| How do you handle untrusted data in a secure manner?| [ ] | [ ] |
| How do you determine how the framework you've chosen mitigates a web app vulnerability?| [ ] | [ ] |
| How to conduct security testing of your web application(s).| [ ] | [ ] |

### Behaviors:
| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to keep security tight on my web applications, **Action:** I reevaluate my web security on a frequent basis. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I don’t have enough experience to confidently break security, in my web app, **Action:** I consider hiring a known white hat attacker to break and report the easiest vulnerabilities to exploit and implement protection against those weaknesses. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs: 
| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Confidentiality, Authentication and Network Security are the key specific security issues with web services. | [ ] | [ ] |
No system is ever totally secure, however, the more popular a web application becomes, the more attractive a target it is to attackers. | [ ] | [ ] |
| You have to think like an attacker to protect yourself from one. | [ ] | [ ] |
