# Ruby - Idiomatic Ruby & Refactorings


## Skill Description

A fellow is able to write ‘beautiful code’ and/or refactor models using different design patterns including Monads 


## Output 

**Task:** Using the sample code from the link below, demonstrate how you’d use _Switch Case with Hashes_ method to refactor the code.

### Knowledge
| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| What’s the difference between ‘each’ and ‘map’? | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to use conditional operators to optimize code for readability, maintainability, and concision. | [ ] | [ ] | | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to use Symbol to_proc method. | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to use Fixnum#times method. | [ ] | [ ] |
| What’s the difference between the ‘Collect’ and  ‘Select’ methods? | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to use the Switch Case with Hashes method. | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to refactor fat ActiveRecord models using the following patterns, - _Value Objects, Service Objects, Form Objects, Query Objects, View Objects, Policy Objects and Decorators._ | [ ] | [ ] |

### Behaviors
| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I add more intrinsic complexity (read: features!) to my application, **Action:** I spread it across a coordinated set of small, encapsulated objects and—at a higher level—modules. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When refactoring fat models, **Action:** I break them down and spread out the logic evenly. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs
| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| “Fat models” cause maintenance issues in large apps and they usually represent a failure to apply the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).| [ ] | [ ] | 
| When refactoring code to improve the quality of Ruby on Rails applications, I learn to break the habit of allowing models to get fat.| [ ] | [ ] |
