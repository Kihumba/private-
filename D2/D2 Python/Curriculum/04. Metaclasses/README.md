## Output: 

**Task:** Using the FlaskRestful documentation, replicate the API

### Behaviors:
| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:**  When I want to automatically insert a known method into a set of classes, **Action:** I simply code the method in a superclass and have all the classes in question inherit from it. | [ ] | [ ] |


### Beliefs:
| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |

| Metaclasses are primarily intended for building APIs and tools for others to use.| [ ] | [ ] |
