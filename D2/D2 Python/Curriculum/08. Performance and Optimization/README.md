# Python - Performance & Optimization


## Skill Description:

A fellow is able to find bottlenecks when building applications, and practice the three rules of optimization to improve performance.

## Output:

**Task:** ??


### Knowledge: 
| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| What are the key rules of of optimization? | [ ] | [ ] |
| What are the tools used for measuring/monitoring performance? | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to find bottlenecks through CPU, memory, and network usage profiling (macro and/or micro-profiling). | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to master key profiling tools for python code, (cProfile (or profile) module, and PyCallGraph) | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to optimize your program through multithreading, multiprocessing and caching. | [ ] | [ ] |


### Behaviors:
| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to optimize a piece of code, **Action:** I remember to focus on three things a) make it work first, b) work from the user's point of view, and c) keep the code readable (thus maintainable.) | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to improve performance, **Action:** I implement an optimization strategy that starts with making sure a third-party server or resource is not faulty. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I to scale a hardware, **Action:** I make sure the resources are sufficient. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I wan to erite a speed test, **Action:** I create a scenario with speed objectives. | [ ] | [ ] |


### Beliefs: 
| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| When a piece of code works, it might be better (sometimes) to leave it alone than to try making it faster at all costs.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| Only optimize what needs optimizing. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Itâ€™s no good just guessing or assuming where the inefficiencies lie in your code. | [ ] | [ ] |
