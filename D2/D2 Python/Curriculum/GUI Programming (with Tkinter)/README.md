# Python - GUI Programming (with Tkinter)

## Skill Description:

A fellow is able to apply Python to build portable graphical user interfaces, primarily with Python’s standard Tkinter library.

# Output: 

Create a GUI application using Tkinter.  All you need to do is perform the following steps −
**Task:** 
Import the Tkinter module.
Create the GUI application main window.
Add one or more of the Tkinter widgets to the GUI application.
Enter the main event loop to take action against each event triggered by the user.


### Knowledge: 
| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| What is GUI programming? | [ ] | [ ] |
| What is Tkinter? | [ ] | [ ] |
| What are the different types widgets (controls) that Tkinter provides in Python? | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to construct a widget in Tkinter. | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to specify standard attributes such as sizes, colors, dimensions and fonts. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| How to use entry widgets to get input, such as text strings, from the user of an application | [ ] | [ ] |
|How to use specific geometry management methods (pack, grid, and place), to control and organize how widgets are arranged in a window | [ ] | [ ] |


### Behaviours:
| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I construct a widget in tkinter, **Action:** I specify how it should be configured, first, as a parent-widget object, and secondly as a configuration option for the Label. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:**  When I’ve constructed widget object trees as models of what you want to see on the screen, **Action:** I then ask the tree to display itself by calling mainloop. | [ ] | [ ] |


### Beliefs:
| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Tkinter programming concepts translate directly to any other GUI toolkit you choose to utilize. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Tkinter is a standard module in the Python library, shipped with the interpreter. | [ ] | [ ] |
| A Label widget can display either text or an icon or other image. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| The entry widget allows the user to enter a single line of text. | [ ] | [ ] |
| The parent-widget argument is the hook used to build up complex GUIs as widget trees.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| Tkinter works on a “what-you-build-is-what-you-get” principle. | [ ] | [ ] |
| If you don’t pass any arguments to pack , you get default packing, which attaches the widget to the top side of its container. | [ ] | [ ] |
