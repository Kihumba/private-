# Python - Secure Web Development  

## Skill Description: 

A fellow understand the major web application security flaws that are commonly exploited by malicious actors, and is able to apply mitigation techniques for security frameworks when building every level of the web application. 

## Output:

**Task:** **Caesar cipher** - Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC". (**Please note:** This simple "monoalphabetic substitution cipher" provides almost no security, because an attacker who has the encoded message can either use frequency analysis to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys.)


### Knowledge:
| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| What are the top 10 web application vulnerabilities? 
| What is cross-site scripting (XSS)? | [ ] | [ ] |
| How does XSS work? | [ ] | [ ] |
| What is SQL injection and session hijacking, and how does it work? | [ ] | [ ] | 
| What is cross site request forgery? | [ ] | [ ] |
| How you you determine how the framework you've chosen mitigates a web app vulnerability? | [ ] | [ ] |
| How do you ensure your code implements the mitigation techniques for your security framework? | [ ] | [ ] |

### Behaviors:
| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to keep security tight on my web applications, **Action:** I reevaluate my web security on a frequent basis. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I donâ€™t have enough experience to confidently break security, in my web app, **Action:** I consider hiring a known white hat attacker to break and report the easiest vulnerabilities to exploit and implement protection against those weaknesses. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs: 
| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Confidentiality, Authentication and Network Security are the key specific security issues with web services. | [ ] | [ ] |
| No system is ever totally secure, however, the more popular a web application becomes, the more attractive a target it is to attackers. | [ ] | [ ] |
| You have to think like an attacker to protect yourself from one. | [ ] | [ ] |
