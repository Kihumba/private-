# Python - Networking: SocketIO, Tornado/AsyncIO

## Skill description:

A fellow is able to access the basic socket support in an underlying operating system to implement clients and servers for both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols, as well as higher-level access to specific application-level network protocols, such as FTP, and HTTP.

## Output:

**Tasks:** Perform at least two or three of the following tasks;
1. **A Simple Client:** Write a simple client program which opens a connection to a given port and given host using Python's socket module function.
2. **A Simple Server:** Write an Internet server, using the socket function available in socket module to create a socket object. Use your socket object to call other functions to setup a socket server.
3. **FTP Program** - Build a file transfer program which can transfer files back and forth from a remote web sever.
4. **Bandwidth Monitor** - Build a small utility program that tracks how much data you have uploaded and downloaded from the net during the course of your current online session. See if you can find out what periods of the day you use more and less and generate a report or graph that shows it.
5. **Port Scanner** - Build a port scanner where when you enter an IP address and a port range, your program can attempt to find open ports on the given computer by connecting to each of them. On any successful connections mark the port as open.

### Behaviors:
| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to o create a socket, **Action:** I use the socket.socket() function available in socket module, which has the general syntax | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to write Internet servers, **Action:** I use the socket function available in socket module to create a socket object. I then use a socket object to call other functions to setup a socket server. | [ ] | [ ] 



### Beliefs:
| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Sockets communicate within a process, between processes on the same machine, or between processes on different continents. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Asynchronous programming is more complex than classical “sequential” programming,therefore I should be aware of the common traps and how to avoid them | [ ] | [ ] |
