# Python - Networking: SocketIO, Tornado/AsyncIO

## Skill description:

A fellow is able to access the basic socket support in an underlying operating system to implement clients and servers for both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols, as well as higher-level access to specific application-level network protocols, such as FTP, and HTTP.

## Output:

**Tasks:** Perform at least two or three of the following tasks;
1. **FTP Program** - Build a file transfer program which can transfer files back and forth from a remote web sever.
2. **Bandwidth Monitor** - Build a small utility program that tracks how much data you have uploaded and downloaded from the net during the course of your current online session. See if you can find out what periods of the day you use more and less and generate a report or graph that shows it.
3. **Port Scanner** - Build a port scanner where when you enter an IP address and a port range, your program can attempt to find open ports on the given computer by connecting to each of them. On any successful connections mark the port as open.
4. **Mail Checker (POP3 / IMAP)** - Build a mail checker where a user enters various account information include web server and IP, protocol type (POP3 or IMAP) and the application will check for email at a given interval.
