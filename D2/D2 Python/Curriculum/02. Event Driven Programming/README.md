# Python - Event Driven Programming

## Skill description:

A fellow is able to use functions such as Twisted to build simple interactive applications by implementing event-driven programs.

### Output:
- **Task**: Write a callback function called “gotopoint” which takes two parameters: the x and y location of where the mouse was clicked. Use this function as a parameter to the onclick method provided by the turtle module to bind the function (gotopoint) to the onclick event. Next, modify the above task by using ontimer method.



### Knowledge:
| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| What is an event-driven programming? | [ ] | [ ] |
| What is event handling? | [ ] | [ ] | 
| How to use the bound() method callback handler to process events and control a widgets’ behavior and appearance. | [ ] | [ ] |
|How to use the callable class object callback handler (command option) to process events registered with command. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Behaviors:
| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to process an event, **Action:** I use the bind() function to bind the event to a widget it’s meant for.
| **Context:** When I want to process an event registered with command, **Action:** I use the callable class object callback handler to process it.


### Beliefs:
| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Events occur relative to a source window of the event. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| Where no client has registered, the event is propagated up the parent window hierarchy
| Where the event reaches the root window, the event is ignored. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Events registered with command, can be called like normal functions. | [ ] | [ ] |
