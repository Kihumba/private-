# Python Regular Expressions

## Skill description:

A fellow is able to use Regular expressions as a powerful and standardized way of searching, replacing, and parsing text with complex patterns of characters. 

## Output:

### Knowledge:

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| What is regular expressions?  | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to use the match function to match RE pattern to string with optional flags? | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to use the search function to search for RE pattern within string with optional flags. | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to use the search and replace method.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to use RE flags. | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to use pythonâ€™s regular expression syntax. | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to compile a pattern for performance. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Behaviors:

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When writing regular expression in Python, **Action:** I use raw strings with special prefix (r) instead of regular Python strings for easy reading. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to test whether a regular expression matches a specific string in Python, **Action:** I use re.search() method. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to perform a global search over the whole input string, **Action:** I use the re.findall() method to return a list of matches, or re.finditer() method to returns an iterator of re.MatchObjects. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to find and replace a part of a string using regular expressions, **Action:** I use the  re.sub() method. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to create a new regular expression pattern to match many strings, **Action:** I use re.compile method. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs:
| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Regular expressions are widely used in UNIX world. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Regular expressions can be concatenated to form new regular expressions. | [ ] | [ ] |
