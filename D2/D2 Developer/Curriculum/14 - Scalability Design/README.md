# Outcome 14 - Scalability Design

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands the importance of scaling, and how scaling impacts the overall goals of the company and end users. The Fellow knows when to make trade-offs between scalability designing for short term and long-terms goals. The Fellow is relentless in thinking about their design decisions and how the product will work in the future at 10x usage.

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. A project with stress tests for scale
2. Notes of scalability design decisions made in project (1)

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When designing a system **Action:** I consider short and long term goals of the system's usage | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** After knowing the short and long term goals of the system's usage **Action:** I consider the tradeoff of designing for 10x of the projected systems usage versus the need to roll out features fast | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** Before deploying a system **Action:** I set up monitoring systems to track usage and the impact of the usage | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When putting together a test suite for a system **Action:** I set up load tests to predict system behavior under different scaling metrics | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When setting up monitoring systems **Action:** I configure the system to autoscale (vertically & horizontally) based on monitoring data | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Considering performance and scalability is a critical part of good system design | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The effort of scalability design is rewarded when the system actually needs it | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Scalability needs are dynamic over time and require regular re-evaluation | [ ] | [ ]  |
