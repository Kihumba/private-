| **Context:** When I'm designing a system **Action:** I draw the use cases and suitable data models for those use cases| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** After drawing the data models **Action:** I do a pros and cons analysis to decide the optimal database for the system | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When setting up a database **Action:** I follow best practices for database security | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have a query that is complex **Action:** I look for ways to optimize the query without affecting the query desired results | [ ] | [ ]  |
