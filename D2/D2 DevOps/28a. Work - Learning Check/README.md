## Work == Learning Check

You've learned a lot of knowledge, facts, and tools so far. Time to put them into practice to see if you really understand how to use and embody the skill, and where you might need to patch up some gaps in your knowledge! 

Choose any or all of the following Outputs or Thought Experiments to work though. It will be most effective if you work with a Peer or mentor to get feedback on your work. 

--- 

1. **Work Output:** Write an example of business/technical requirements translated into test cases, etc. Then, outline how you will communicate your estimation of time spend/expectations to your stakeholders to verify that it meets their expectations and make adjustments where necessary.

2. **Thought Experiment:** Extract your work from a sprint planning session: A Marketing person at your company says to your team, “We are going to demo this feature to X client at X time.” How do you, as a DevOps team member, know what that means for the work you need to do? Will Marketing need a testing server for their demo? Will the development team need deployment support? What questions do you need to ask to make sure you have clarity in your upcoming responsibilities?
