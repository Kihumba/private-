# Work == Learning Check: Number 1

You've learned a lot of knowledge, facts, and tools so far. Time to put them into practice to see if you really understand how to use and embody the skill, and where you might need to patch up some gaps in your knowledge! 

Choose any or all of the following Outputs or Thought Experiments to work though. It will be most effective if you work with a Peer or mentor to get feedback on your work. 

----

1. Choose your tool when you setup your environment, and explain why you chose that specific tool. 
    - Tool choices: Docker, Vagrant, GitHub, other. 


2. Deploy to your own personal accounts to mimic real life work... without the risk of messing up a Partner's code! Take a project from the start of it being deployed on GitHub to a Server where it Functions. 
   - Have your own personal accounts on GCP, AWS, Heroku… that will help you play around for free for a year.
   - You can fork an Andela code base or Partner code to practice
   - Don’t be afraid to break things-- make a safe space where you can fail and learn from failure. Where you can try new tools and see the benefits and drawbacks of each.
