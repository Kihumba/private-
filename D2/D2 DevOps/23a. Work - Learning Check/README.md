## Work == Learning Check




----

1. *Work Output:* “Play” with the industry-wide tools to really understand how they work, not just how to use them in their basic functions. Read documentation. Experiment. How can you create an instance on them? How do they interact with other tools and environments? Experiment with the tools that you use on your Partner work already, and with the tools that you don’t get to use that are still industry standards. 

2. *On Partner Work:* Go above and beyond- Get hands-on experience. Take on the extra work. Go above and beyond your responsibilities. If you’re worried about messing something up, test it on your own servers first. The best way to learn is to be thrown into the deep end.

3. *On Partner Work:* Ask your peers and team for support-- if you have questions, they probably have them too, or have worked through them in the past.
