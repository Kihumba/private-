Cloud Academy-- Good DevOps Paths
A great place to “play with” tools, set them up, and try out their functionalities is in the lab section of Cloud Academy, linked here. 
Do research and read documentation while you work. Sometimes, you may be doing more reading than working, but that will make your work more effective in the end. Documentation (for DevOps tools in particular) is your best friend-- fall in love with it. Dig in. Read articles.
