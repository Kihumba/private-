# Case Studies and Real World Practice

Going through these practice opportunities and real-world case studies is a great way to learn from mistakes and successes... without having to break any functioning code!

Use these Independent Learning Resources consistently throughout your time as a DevOps Engineer to get new ideas, learn new concepts, practice old skills, and prepare for the unknown.
