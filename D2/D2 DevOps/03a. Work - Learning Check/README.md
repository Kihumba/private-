## Work == Learning Check: Number 2

You've learned a lot of knowledge, facts, and tools so far. Time to put them into practice to see if you really understand how to use and embody the skill, and where you might need to patch up some gaps in your knowledge! 

Choose any or all of the following Outputs or Thought Experiments to work though. It will be most effective if you work with a Peer or mentor to get feedback on your work.

1. Choose your tool when you set up your CI/CD, explain why you chose that specific tool: Travis, Circle CI, Jenkins
2. Set up Unit Test Checks on your CI/CD pipeline. Set up Integration tests check on your CI/CD pipeline. Make sure to [use the proper testing Environment](https://github.com/andela/learningmap/tree/master/D2/D2%20DevOps/1.%20Proper%20Use%20of%20Environments).
3. **Thought Experiment:** Your partner comes to you and says, “We need to set up secure deployments.” What questions do you ask? What would you need to do to make sure you have Continuous Integration & Deployment? What tools would you suggest and why?
