## Work == Learning Check

You've learned a lot of knowledge, facts, and tools so far. Time to put them into practice to see if you really understand how to use and embody the skill, and where you might need to patch up some gaps in your knowledge! 

Choose any or all of the following Outputs or Thought Experiments to work though. It will be most effective if you work with a Peer or mentor to get feedback on your work. 

--- 

1. Create a recovery plan and verify a backup-- make sure you confirm that your data will be maintained through your plan, or define how to deal with any missing or lost data. 
2. How would you deal with an issue with your product’s API? Using your tools, simulate and fix that issue.
3. *Thought Experiment:* Troubleshooting an error in a code base- A developer on your team has changed a file in your project, and you as the DevOps engineer go to deploy it… and the server does not start. What do you do to figure out what happened and how to fix it?
