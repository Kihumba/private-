## Work == Learning Check 


You've learned a lot of knowledge, facts, and tools so far. Time to put them into practice to see if you really understand how to use and embody the skill, and where you might need to patch up some gaps in your knowledge! 

Choose any or all of the following Outputs or Thought Experiments to work though. It will be most effective if you work with a Peer or mentor to get feedback on your work. 

--- 

1. **On Partner Work:** Draw out your DevOps Team, what each of their responsibilities is. Shadow your teammates and record what they do on a daily basis. Try for a full week of shadowing 1hr/day at different times. Ask questions!
>> - Ask what they do on a daily basis
>> - Ask about their sprints
>> - Ask about what the rest of the team is working on

2. **On Partner Work:** Identify and write up your Partner’s Business goals and where DevOps fits in… who are your stakeholders? Who are your Andela Stakeholders? Draw your complete understanding of your busines, team, goals, roles, and history.

3. **Thought Experiment:** There’s no money in the AWS account, we would need to fund the account to do this project, can we fund it? What would be the return on that money? Would it save the business money by automating and preventing us from having to hire more developers? What are our alternatives and tradeoffs if we can’t spend that money? How would you communicate these tradeoffs and your ultimate recommendations to your stakeholders?
