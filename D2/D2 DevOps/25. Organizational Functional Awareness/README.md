# Organizational Functional Awareness ("Business Context")

### Skill Description
DevOps engineers, even more than developers it may be argued, must understand the holistic picture of their business, both from an operational and a technical perspective. They must be able to look at their work across projects, products, and teams, and communicate the impact of their daily work on the organization as a whole. The Fellow understands the core purpose, function of teams/departments of B2B & B2C companies and how they ultimately contribute to the goals of a company. At a D2 Level, a DevOps engineer should be able to source their own tasks from Business or team needs without those tasks being explicitly outlined for them. This is the most important distinction between a D1 DevOps Engineer and a D2 DevOps Engineer: the ability to gain an understanding of the whole business and where DevOps fits in and impacts the bottom line
