# Role Description

A D2 DevOps Engineer is expected to develop both deeper technical skills and a broader understanding of the business context in which they operate. They should have a clear picture of the environment they work on and how to effectively manage and/or administer a project in different environments. 

A D2 DevOps Engineers role may vary dramatically with respect to their responsibilities, but they should be prepared to write code for automation scripting or to build out libraries if necessary. 

They should be able to manage and reduce risks and handle downtimes. In the world of tools, a D2 DevOps Engineer has experience with several tools, and is very comfortable picking up documentation to understand not only how to use the tool but why it works. When a tool that they are using breaks, they should be very comfortable digging into documentation to figure out what went wrong, or building new tools instead-- in other words, they don’t just know how to drive the car, they can also change the tires if things go wrong. 

Finally, they should understand the impact of their DevOps work on the broader business context, and be able to translate business and/or technical requirements into test cases.

## D1 >> D2 Delta 

From D1 to D2 DevOps Engineer, many of your day to day tasks and responsibilities may remain the same. What will change is the depth of your understanding of those tasks and how they integrate both with each other and with the rest of the business function. 

For example, as a D1 DevOps Engineer your team lead may have provided you with a list of requirements or tasks that you were responsible for, perhaps including maintenance, deployment, integration, etc. As a D2, you will be expected to be able to extrapolate those responsibilities from the needs of the development team and the business. Similarly, you should be aware of the goals of your business and how your work impacts them directly-- what is the cost and business implication of a downtime, for example? Finally, you’ll be expected to have deeper insights into certain errors and be able to interpret them quickly based on past experience.

## Uses Tools Such As... 
As a D2 DevOps Engineer, you should expect to learn new tools every step of the way, on every project and on your own time. A D2 DevOps Engineer makes it their business to acquaint themselves with the different tools available for each stage of the DevOps Process, has “played” with the tools on their own to get a sense of their strengths and weaknesses, and has examined the tools in terms of: 

- Security
- Scalability
- Cost
- Server types
- Tools that are better for deployment, infrastructure maintenance or both

As a D2 DevOps Engineer, you should be able to do more technical tasks with the same set of available DevOps Tools, and should be a leader in best practices. For example, a D1 DevOps Engineer can demonstrate how to use “Terraform” to provision and destroy infrastructure. A D2 DevOps Engineer should be able to demonstrate how Terraform can be used for Multi-Cloud Deployment, Multi-Tier Applications, Disposable Environments, etc, and would store their states in S3 or GCS.
