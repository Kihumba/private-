### Work == Learning Check 

You've learned a lot of knowledge, facts, and tools so far. Time to put them into practice to see if you really understand how to use and embody the skill, and where you might need to patch up some gaps in your knowledge! 

Choose any or all of the following Outputs or Thought Experiments to work though. It will be most effective if you work with a Peer or mentor to get feedback on your work.

1. Write a Unix Script that helps you Unit Test and Service Test your CI/CD (you can do this in Bash using Yammer or another programming language). Apply your programming best practices to your script.  
- Refactor your script to ensure it aligns with SOLID principles
- Run your test script. 

2. **Thought Experiment:** You’re asked to implement 3-tier architecture for your partner-- why might this be a good choice? What are each of the layers? What other patterns could you use?

3. **Thought Experiment:** A Developer on your team changes a file on your team's project, and you deploy the project—- and the server doesn’t start! What do you do? How do you dig into the code to figure out what happened?
