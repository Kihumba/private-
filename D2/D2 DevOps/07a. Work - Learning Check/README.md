# Work == Learning Check: Number 4


You've learned a lot of knowledge, facts, and tools so far. Time to put them into practice to see if you really understand how to use and embody the skill, and where you might need to patch up some gaps in your knowledge! 

Choose any or all of the following Outputs or Thought Experiments to work though. It will be most effective if you work with a Peer or mentor to get feedback on your work.

1. After setting up CI, use your skills of Release Engineering to deploy to a server (or to a Play Store if you are working with a mobile application). 
2. Document your Configuration and Change Management process to clearly describe how you will manage bugs that may arise in your product (will you have a new version number after each bug fix, or a subset of an existing version? How does that decision get made? How do you keep track of the last 10-20 builds you have so that you can see what was happening in each and revert back if necessary?)
3. Integrate your knowledge of Build Management and Version Control to make sure to version your deployments. Demonstrate the Version control youâ€™ve learned in D1, but demonstrate it in a more encompassing way through your complete documentation and set up of Circle CI or another tool of your choice.
