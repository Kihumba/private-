At a D2 Level, a DevOps Engineer seeks & requests feedback and responds in a structured and systematic way (e.g.,using ASK Feedback and taking feedback to creating S.M.A.R.T. goals).

### Resources
- **Behavior:** If I am blocked for more than 20 minutes on partner work, I first reach out to internal Andela Resources or mentors.
- **Behavior:** If I am still blocked and cannot reach Andela resources, I reach out to my main point of contact at my partner to let them know I am doing research to try to get around the blocker. 
- **Behavior:** When there is someone who can help me get unstuck, I proactively set up a video call to discuss
- **Behavior:** When I am done with work for the day, I proactively send updates to my team via slack or another messaging system we use. 
- **Behavior:** When I do not understand something about the tools I am using or the domain my company works in, I proactively research on my own to deepen my understanding as much as possible. 
- **Belief:** The most important skill to have as a DevOps engineer is curiosity-- and the proactivity to research to answer the questions you have!
